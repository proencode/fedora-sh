Introduction to Website Building 
 
Days are gone when people depend mainly on manual way of carrying out their 
functions and businesses. Today, many things have changed in a very big way. 
People are searching for how to development their skills in technologically related 
approach. 
Some people want to learn what is trending because the old skills they learnt are 
not selling well again. A friend once said that a time will come in the life of a man 
when things in office work will change totally. He said that that time work like face 
to face marketing by employees will not sell much again. 
What companies will be doing then will be using their technologically amplified 
machines and skills to make sales. They advertise their products and services 
through their websites and make sales through their mobile applications. And the 
surprising thing is that it seems what he said is already happening. 
With the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic disease in the year 2019, many workplaces 
including offices were short down. The economies of many nations were put at 
standstill. 
Many companies and individuals lost a lot of money with this outbreak. Even some 
companies sacked their workers because they could not afford to pay them again. 
It was a big problem. 
But do you know what? Irrespective of this pandemic, some companies were still 
making good money as profit. Examples of such companies are Netflix, Google, 
Microsoft, and Amazon. You may ask why the pandemic did not affect them. 
The answer is simple; they embraced technology and utilized them. Those compa- 
nies are all tech amplified companies. They make their money through websites or 
online businesses. 
One of the skills that you as a reader of this book need is tech skill. And an exam- 
ple of the tech skill is website building and website design which work hand in 
hand. You are handling the right book and I will guide you through on how to do 
this. If you need more clarification after reading through this book, you can send 
email to me personally. I will not hesitate to answer you. 
Believe me you will be happy you spent money to buy this book. I am here to
guide. You will learn A-Z information on what you need to build a website of your 
choice and how to do it. Even if you need a book on how to build a specific kind of 
website, write to me and I will put you through. I will leave my email on one of the 
last pages of this book. 
 
## Why you need to Learn Website Building and Design 

![ Fig 1: Reasons to learn website building ](fig_1_reasons_to_learn.webp)

The terms website design and website building are used interchangeably, so
whether we use "website design" or "website building", we are talking about two 
related ideas because a professional cannot build a website without designing the 
site. The reasons you need to learn website design skill are: 
1. It will give you idea on how things work on the web. Doing so will make you see 
WebPages you see as real and not a product of magic. When some people do not 
understand how certain tasks were carried out, they were carried away when they 
see the operation of such things. 
2. Website building skills places you ahead of other prospective employees seeking 
for job. When you possess this skill, you are respected. When job applicants are 
called for job interview and almost everyone have similar skills, you having some- 
thing different and unique will put you ahead of the others. Such skill sends a mes- 
sage to the management of the company that this guy or lady is different from oth- 
ers. He can help us in tech section! 
3. Having web building skill can make you earn money. Website design skill is a 
selling skill in this twenty first century. There are companies who are searching for 
website builders to help them in building and maintaining websites. Some of these 
companies are ready to pay you well in as much as you help them create stunning 
sites. What they need is satisfaction. 
Once they are satisfied with your work, they are ready to pay you well and employ 
you as permanent staff or pay you on contract basis. When they pay you on con- 
tract, they give you freedom to build for other clients and make more money for 
yourself. In developed countries, website builders live large because they earn well. 
4. Web building and design skills can make you to be self-employed. Unlike some 
office works whereby you must be answerable to a buy, a website builder who has 
networks of clients do not necessarily need to be answerable to any boss before he 
can eat. A great designer of the web who has many clients can be a boss of his or 
her own. 
He can earn more than the people that are paid on salary basis. Being a website de- 
signer gives you the opportunity to explore other skills you have. You draw you 
plan on when you want to complete a client project and when you want to go into 
other side earning works. You cease to be limited by any boss in any office. 
5. When you are a website builder, people respect you because of the skill. To so 
many out there, that is not a skill that is easy to acquire. But to be honest with you, 
it is easy these days and that is what I will be teaching you in this book. I could 
remember the surprises I saw in people's face when I told them that I am a website 
builder. It is an honor to be someone that builds a platform that people from dif- 
ferent parts of the world can see and visit irrespective of their locations. 
 
## The Tools you need to Build a Website 

You might have seen some posts on the web telling you what you need to be able 
to build a website. You might have seen some books telling you about plenty of 
tools you need to create a website that people can access from different parts of 
the world. They may be right about those tools you read about. They may tell you 
or sorts of technical jargons. They are right with their jargons? 
But let me ask you, what did they tell you? They told you that you need deep knowl- 
edge of HTML 5, CSS, Java Script, JQuery, PHP/TWIG/ASP.NET ETC, Adobe
Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Mockup / Wire framing Tools? 
At seeing those terms alone, you got tired, right? You even went and bought some 
books to learn those jargons, but you could not understand what was written in 
that book. Did that happen to you? You were studying one of the textbooks and you 
were tired already. 
When you looked at the bunch of codes on the book, you were engulfed in fear. 
You asked yourself where you go from here. How do I get this thing done? 
Hey, listen to me; you do not need deep knowledge about those jargons at a 
dummy stage. Read that line again. Do you get that clear? I said you do not need 
deep knowledge on those areas for now. What should be your interest for now is 
how to build a website that is working properly and with time you can understand 
those areas you read in books or articles. 
As a website builder, I am here to help you. I want to teach you the simple ways to 
do it without deep knowledge in coding. Things have changed and those materials 
you have been reading may be outdated by now. 
The tools you need to build a website as a beginner are your internet connection, 
your few dollars as from $20 up to pay for domain name registration and hoisting, 
your laptop or any working computer, and your attentiveness to learn. These are all 
you need to build a website. 
In fact, you can even do without laptop computer. If you know your way, you can 
create websites using your mobile phone. Did that sound surprising to you? As a 
designer, I have built some sites from my phone. 
What I do is that when it gets to technical sections, I fall back to my laptop to set 
things up. As for now, you get your laptop to have clearer view and understanding 
of what we will be doing. Many things have changed in website building and that's 
why am giving you updated information. 
Don't say this loud. It is a secret so keep it. Are you listening gently? Many website 
builders do not give you details on how to build and design websites in free arti- 
cles because they want you to pay before you can learn the skill. That is why they 
confuse your head with many technical jargons. 
 
## What is Website Building and Website Design 

Before going deep into the main terms, let us know what a website is. A website is 
a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common do- 
main name and published on at least one web server. A domain name is the name 
that identifies a website. Domain names are given by Domain Name Registrars. If a 
domain name is already registered by a particular person, another person cannot 
register that same name. 
In a website like www.amazon.com, the domain name is "amazon". There cannot 
be any two amazon on internet. But from the main domain name subdomain can 
be obtained. That is to say that other websites can be created from the principal 
name “amazon”. For example, www.kdp.amazon.com is a subdomain website cre- 
ated from www.amazon.com. 
Website building is the action of constructing a website. In website building, the 
website builder starts from the scratch to the completion of the website. He starts 
from the domain name registration and then gets to the design aspect of the site.
He chooses the hoisting company he believes will hold the pages always on the 
web by having the site files in their server. After that he pays them before he finally 
starts the design of the project. In other words a website builder does more of the 
job than a designer of websites. But the two are taken to do the same job in market. 
So in this book, we are using the market approach to use the two terms. 
Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It 
usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than 
software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for 
desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet 
browsers has become ever-increasingly important. 
Before some designers of the web start with their design job, they first draw plans. 
The plans can be on a paper. That is just a sketch of what they want to have dis- 
played on the website after the final design. 
The design can be the components of the menu bar, the slides on the header of the 
site, single or double site bars, the contents of the body of the site, the site pages, 
the contents of the site footer and the kind of logo to use. 
Some expert designers of the web usually have the design on their head. They add 
the designs of what they want on the site as they progress. At the end of the design, 
they have stunning work that every visitor to the website is pleased with. In some 
cases, websites can be redesigned even when it has started its full function. 
 
## Types of Websites 

There are different types of websites. And classifications of websites can depend 
on many factors. Website can be classified base on use. That is to say that they are 
classified based on what they are used for. Also, website can be classified on host- 
ing and on the nature of the web pages. 
On the other hand, websites are classified base on the nature or state of the web 
pages. Web pages as used here mean the posts on the website. 

### Types of Website base on use

Types of website base on what they are used for are as follow: 
1. ECommerce Website 
2. Business Website 
3. Entertainment Website 
4. Portfolio Website 
5. Media Website 
6. Brochure Website 
7. Organizational website 
8. Educational Website 
9. Infopreneur Website 
10. Personal Website 
11. Web Portal and 
12. Community Forum Website 

### Types of Website base on Hosting 

Types of website base on hosting are: 
- Hosted and 
- Self-hosted website

### Hosted Website 

A hosted website is one that is built on a website builder such as Wix, Squares- 
pace, WordPress.com and blogger.com. These are software as a Service (SAAS) 
platforms offering an all-in-one website solution. They provide the hosting (the 
servers that house all your website files) and the software to build your website. 
But you’re limited to using their tools and templates, and you have limited, if any, 
access to the code for customization. 

### Self-hosted Website 

A self-hosted website is the type of website a person pays to website hosting com- 
pany to have the domain on their server, pays to domain name registrars to get the 
domain name, and then design the website to his taste. In this kind of website, the 
website builder has access to play with codes on the site and customize it to his 
type. This is the type of website we are discussing in this book. 
A self-hosted site gives you the freedom to create whatever you want. There are 
many hosting companies that allow you to achieve your aim of building self-hosted 
sites by helping you have your website files stored in their servers. Example of 
these website hosting companies are Hostgator.com, InMotion Hosting, 
Hostinger, Cloudways, Hostwinds, GoDaddy, Bluehost, iPage, Smartweb.com.ng, 
interserver.net, and WordPress.org. Do not be confused between WordPress.org 
and WordPress.com because their functions vary. 

## Classification of Websites base on Action/Motion 

Websites can be classified bases on their ability to move or not. In this kind of 
classification, we have static and dynamic websites. 

### Static Website 

The word static refers to something that is fixed, that doesn’t move or change in 
any way. This is somehow a little highlight on what a static page is about. No ele- 
ments on this page are changed when accessing it. Static websites are basic pages 
that require simple code and design elements to create. “Static” also refers to the 
website being fixed in terms of page numbers. A fixed number of pages are deliv- 
ered just the way it is designed and stored. The website can contain only 2 pages. 
Static web pages are suitable for content that never or rarely needs to be updated, 
though modern web template systems are changing this. Maintaining large num- 
bers of static pages as files can be impractical without automated tools, such as 
static site generators. 
In static websites, the HTML codes are not generated on the server. This makes it 
difficult to edit the posts on the website. 
Static websites consist of HTML, CSS and Java Script. But sometimes not all these 
computer languages are necessarily contained on a static website. As we said be- 
fore, in static websites, the codes are not generated on the server. In static website, 
the page content can change through java script on the browser but not on the 
server. 
Please note that a site is called a static website does not mean the site does not 
change. What it implies is that the change cannot be done on server. The page con- 
tent can change in the browser through java script. But the files on server remain 
the same. The files are prebuilt during development and not changed on server. 

### Dynamic Websites

This type of website is different from static website as the HTML codes are gener- 
ated from the server and can easily be changed. The HTML markups of dynamic 
websites are dynamically on server. 
A dynamic website is a site that contains dynamic pages such as templates, con- 
tents, scripts etc. In a nutshell, the dynamic website displays various content types 
every time it is browsed. The web page can be changed with the reader that opens 
the page, character of consumer interplay, or daytime. 
In this kind of website, a reader may be reading a post on the site, you as an admi- 
nistrator changes some files on the post, and immediately the reader refreshes the 
page sees something different. The difference is because of the quick changes you 
made in the files stored in the server that stores the files. 
In dynamic websites, the HTML codes are built dynamically for each request. Dy- 
namic website requires a host who keeps your site alive on their server. Host needs 
to support the chosen server-side language in this kind of website. 
These websites are truly dynamic, meaning that the data and content in text, im- 
ages, video, voice, and animation etc can be ever changing just like in real time. In 
this, the owner of the website has an Admin Log in Panel to access his dashboard 
to update new changes directly to the server where the website files are stored if he 
has website building skill. 
Examples of dynamic websites like Blogspot Blogs, WordPress Blogs, Any E- 
commerce sites, Calendar or to-do sites, and news websites. Dynamic sites use 
languages like PHP to interact with information stored in databases. 
 
## The History of Website 

This is a very important section to know in technical title like this. History of Web 
(Website) is what many website builders do not think about sometimes. 
It is good for us to have idea of when website began its existence. If you do not 
know, you may think that web just started 10 years ago. The truth is that World 
Wide Web is old. But the dynamism we have in it makes it simple. Web has been 
invented about 22 years ago in respect to the first publication time of this book 
(year 2020). 
It is the work of a great thinker who has passion for computer and software devel- 
opment. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British, invented the World Wide Web. He is an 
intelligent man with great ideas. 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist. He was born in London, and 
his parents were early computer scientists, working on one of the earliest com- 
puters.

![ Fig 1.1: Sir Tim Berners-Lee ](fig_1.1_sir_tim_berners-lee.webp)

He later graduated from Oxford University and entered the real world. He started 
work at CERN. In that organization, he worked as software engineer. CERN is the 
large particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. 
Scientists came from all over the world to use its accelerators, but Sir Tim noticed 
that they were having difficulty sharing information. He saw such as technical 
issue. 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee thought he saw a way to solve this problem – one that he 
could see could also have much broader applications. Already, millions of 
computers were being connected together through the fast-developing internet and 
Berners-Lee realized they could share information by exploiting an emerging tech- 
nology called hypertext. 
The great scientist saw the vision of how website can be built to make information 
go round together without much stress. In March 1989, Tim laid out his vision for 
what would become the web in a document called “Information Management: A 
Proposal”. Though his proposal looked great, it was not accepted immediately. His 
boss then by name Mike Sendall delayed working on the proposal first. 
Later, Mike allowed Sir Tim to start working on the project. This Tim began in Sep- 
tember 1990. He began the work using a NeXT computer. 
By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that re- 
main the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts 
of your web browser). The three fundamental technologies are: 
HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the 
web. 
URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to 
identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. 
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources 
from across the web. 
As an inventor, Sir Tim first wrote the first webpage editor/browser (“World- 
WideWeb.app”) ever known and the first web server (“httpd"). Tim completed the 
project before the end of December 1990. 
When he first created the web, to access it was not free. Then, to check some
documents on the web, you had to pay. You also must ask for permission before 
you could view anything. With time, the inventor had a rethink and decided to 
make the web free for all. That opened the door to many good things we enjoy 
today. 
The inventor of the web asked CERN to make the underlying codes of the web 
known by the entire world. After much deliberation on the good doors such will 
open, the organization approved it. They did that without charge. This decision was 
announced in April 1993, and sparked a global wave of creativity, collaboration and 
innovation never seen before. 
In 2003, the companies developing new web standards committed to a Royalty 
Free Policy for their work. In 2014, the year we celebrated the web’s 25th birthday, 
almost two in five people around the world were using it. Web has really helped 
man which among them is job, ease of doing business, free access to information 
and dynamism. 
In 1994 Sir Tim moved from CERN to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He is a professor in the university. 
He is the founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international 
community devoted to developing open web standards. W3Schools is optimized 
for learning, testing, and training. He remains the Director of W3C to the time of 
publication of this book (June 2020). 
Should in case you do not know, W3C is an open source website whereby you can 
learn anything about computer coding. 
The learning is free. The day I visited that site, I was amazed at what I saw. You can
also learn more about codes from that platform. The website link is https:// 
www.w3schools.com. 
In 2009, Sir Tim established the World Wide Web Foundation. The Web Foun- 
dation is advancing the Open Web to build a just and thriving society by con- 
necting everyone, raising voices and enhancing participation. 

 
# Chapter 2 Choosing a Domain Name and Hosting 

 
This is the real thing. It is where the journey of creating website starts from. If you 
have no domain name, there is no way you will own a website. The first thing you 
must do in creating a website for yourself or someone else is to choose a domain 
name. 
A domain name is that name which you want your website to answer. A domain 
name is your website name. A domain name is the address where internet users 
can access your website. 
First thing is to pick a domain name and another thing is to check whether the do- 
main name is available for you to answer. Yes, that is it. If the domain name has 
been taken by someone else, you cannot answer that domain name. Example, for 
the website www.amazon.com, the domain name is "amazon". What that implies is 
that there cannot be two "amazon" on the web. That unique name has been given 
to the company by domain name registrars. 

Fig 2: Picture showing amazon as a domain name 
a![ Fig 2: Picture showing amazon as a domain name ](fig_2_picture_showing_amazon.webp)
 
## What you should know in Choosing Domain name 

There are things you need to know before you choose a domain name. These are as 
follow: 
- A domain name is combination of letters that forms a unit. What I mean is that 
the letter that forms the domain name cannot be separated from each other. For 
example, you can have a domain name as "donsmart" but cannot have a domain 
name as "don smart". That space is not allowed. 
- A domain name once chosen and registered cannot be changed. Before you reg- 
ister a domain name, you should know that it cannot be changed until it expires.
aOtherwise, you register another domain name for yourself, and that will be double 
expenses. 
- Make your domain name short and easy to capture. It is better you make your do- 
main name short and something that will be easy for your website readers to 
remember. If you want to make it long, just do it in a way that people can remem- 
ber it. It is better to have a website URL as "www.smartlearn.com" than having 
"www.uzfsyulearn.com". 
Can you see the difference in the two? The domain name "smartlearn" can easily be 
remembered by readers that "uzfsyulearn". Readers will find it difficult to pro- 
nounce that second domain name. This will make then not to visit the site if they 
want to visit it again later. Because they could not pronounce the name, they could 
not visit the site as they forgot the domain name. 
 
## Domain Name Registration 

You must first register your domain name through any website hosting company. It 
is this hosting company that will make sure that your website is always online. In 
the other words, they will make sure that your files are stored in their server. Any 
time people visit your website, these files appear as posts in the eyes of readers. 
There are several website hosting companies you can host your website with. 
When you visit their websites, you first check with their tool on the website to know 
if the website name you want to take is available. If it is, you can proceed with the 
registration. 
At the end, you pay the company and then they register your domain for you. The 
website hosting company on their own then take the money for domain name 
registration, for giving you domain name, and for keeping your files and web active 
on the internet. 
Some hosting companies allow people to pay for at least one-year hosting of their 
websites. But in the recent time we have seen some changes in the duration of 
hosting. There are some registrars of websites that can allow you to pay for 1 to 3 
months period. An example of such domain name registrar (also the same with 
website hosting company) is Inter Server with website URL as www.interserver.net. 

Fig 2.1: Inter Server homepage 
![ Fig 2.1: Inter Server homepage ](fig_2.1_inter_server_homepage.webp)

If you are a beginner, you can start with this website hosting company. Inter Server 
is cool and fine for people who do not know much about web building. With this 
company, you can just subscribe for 3 months to experiment on what you have 
learned. After that you can decide whether to extend it and continue making use of 
the site. 
There are many website hosting companies today. In United States alone, there is 
over 900 website hosting companies in the country. It is your choice to make on 
the one you want to use to host your website. The prices paid varies as well. It is 
like you deciding on the price to sell an item to people and another seller deciding 
on the price to sell that same product in his own shop. 
Some website hosting companies are as follow: 
- GoDaddy 
- Google Cloud Platform 
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
- BlueHost 
- Squarespace 
- Namecheap 
- HostGator 
- Automattic 
- Wix Hosting 
- Liquid Web 
- DreamHost 
- Weebly
- Digital Ocean 
- InMotion Hosting 
- Rackspace 
- Peedam Hosting 
- Linode 
- Leaseweb 
- Media Temple 
- EGI Hosting 
- Cogeco Peer 
- Network Solutions 
- SiteGround 
-HostMonster 
-Psychz Networks 
- iPage 
-A2 Hosting 
- SoftLayer 
- Smart Web 
- Hostway 
- Inter Server 
So out of the above listed website hosting companies, you are to make your choice 
on the one to use. They are all confirmed domain name registrars. In the next head- 
ing, I will be taking you on the practical approach on how to register a domain 
name through any of the hosting companies. 
 
## Practical: Step-by-Step Guide in Registering your Domain Name 

### Step 1 

Visit the website of any of the above listed website hosting companies. If you do 
not know the direct link or the URL of the hosting company, you can search for the 
name through Google. The website of BlueHost is https://www.bluehost.com, that 
of GoDaddy is https://uk.godaddy.com, and that of Inter Server is https:// 
www.interserver.net. 
 
### Step 2 

Check for the domain name availability. You are to search the homepage of the 
hosting company you visited to know if that name you want to give your website is 
available. There is usually a search box provided for you to do so on the website. 

Fig 2. 1: Searching for domain name availability 
![ Fig 2. 1: Searching for domain name availability ](fig_2._1_searching_for_domain.webp)

If you search and the name has been taken, you have to try another name. You keep 
trying until you get the one that is free. But sometimes, if a domain name has been 
taken, the person that took it can still resell it to you if he or she has not built com- 
plete website on it. But he or she will do that at higher price if you really need it. 
Example is the experience I hard when I wanted to register techkindle before I fi- 
nally chose teachkindle.

![ Fig 2. 2: When someone has taken your domain name choice but wants to pay higher to get it. ](fig_2._2_when_someone_has.webp)
 
### Step 3: Building with the Available Domain Name 

Because the name I want to use for my website is not available and I don't want to 
pay that amount of money to get it from the person that first registered it, I then try 
another name. 
At this stage I choose to try another domain name called "teachkindle". If I try and 
the name is free, I can go with it. But if it not available, I will keep on trying. Once 
the domain is available, you see a message like “CONGRATULATIONS YOUR DO- 
MAIN IS AVAILABLE”. 
 
### Step 4: Sign Up with the Hosting Company 

Since the name you want your website to bear is available, you then signup with the 
website hosting company you want to use. In the signup, you fill in the major infor- 
mation required from you. If you already had account with the website hosting 
company, you can sign in using your email address you have with them and your 
password. 
I will show you sample. When I hosted recently, I used Inter Server hosting com- 
pany. I didn't not use GoDaddy again though I searched for domain name using 
their platform. You can still do the same using Inter Server website hosting com- 
pany. I signed up with them before I could continue to make payment for my do- 
main name "teachkindle".

Fig 2.3: The sign up in progress 
![ Fig 2.3: The sign up in progress ](fig_2.3_the_sign_up.webp)

Once you sign up for an account with the company successfully, they will send you 
email within a short time on how to continue with your purchase of the domain 
name. You can get an email in this format: 
“Hello! 
 
Your InterServer account has been created. 
 
Login Name Smart*********014@gmail.com 
 
This sign up came from IP address **7.21*.84.**7 
 
You can login to your account by visiting https://my.interserver.net 
 
You can reset your password visiting https://my.interserver.net/password.php 
 
-- 
Thank You, 
Team Interserver” 
 
### Step 5: Login and Choose a Package 

So, since you know that a particular domain you finally decided your website will 
answer is free, you are to login to the website of the same web hosting company. 
You will see "web hosting" on top or by the side of the website. Click on that and 
then search for the domain name again in the search box for verification purpose. 
The congratulations message showing you that the name is free will come up
again. 
You will be shown some packages. The packages vary by price. The reason is be- 
cause each package has some features that make them higher than the other. In 
Inter Server for instance the packages the hosting company has are STANDARD 
WEB HOSTING, RS ONE, RS TWO, RS THREE, RS FOUR, RS FIVE, ASP.NET WEB 
HOSTING, WORDPRESS MANAGED HOSTING, and STAY HOME PROMOTION. 
As a beginner, I advise you go for Standard web hosting. Other website hosting 
companies have terms they use to categorize their packages also. 
As you select any package, you will be shown how much you are to pay for a pack- 
age per duration you want to own the domain. You can decide to own the domain 
for 3 months or a year. 

Fig 2.4: Picture showing standard package chosen for a domain and the amount to 
pay 
![ Fig 2.4: Picture showing standard package ](fig_2.4_picture_showing_standard.webp)

Note: The domain name teachkindle20.com was chosen for this particular demon- 
stration. In other stages and this entire teaching, we will be using teachkindle.com 
for most of our illustrations. 
 
### Step 6: Billing and Payment 

This is the next step. Then when you proceed to the next step after choosing your 
plan, you will be shown an invoice of how much you will pay. 
You will be given some options on the method you want to use to make the pay- 
ment. Some hosting companies has up to 3 payment options whiles others do 
have less. You can be given the options to pay with card, direct deposit to the bank, 
or pay with PayPal. But some domain name registers have the option of pay with 
card and Payment with PayPal account. 
In pay with card option, you input your debit or credit card number and the CVV 
number at the back of the card. CVV mean Card Verification Value. It is usually a 3 
digit number at the back of credit or debit card. 

Fig 2.5: Image showing the CVV of a Master Card 
![ Fig 2.5: Image showing the CVV of a Master Card ](fig_2.5_image_showing_the.webp)

After you enter the information for your account to be debited, you will get a secu- 
rity code sent to you by your bank through your phone number asking for your ap- 
proval for your account to be debited. A box will be provided for you by the hosting 
company to enter the code. Once you enter the code correctly in the box, your ac- 
count will be debited. 
You will get a confirmation email in your inbox confirming your payment. The host- 
ing company will also send you details on how to login to your control panel and 
install any program/application to start building your own website. The details to
be sent to you for you to be able to log in to your email is your username or email 
and password. You are to keep them safe. 

Fig 2.5: Confirmation email received after paying for hosting a domain 
![ Fig 2.5: Confirmation email received after ](fig_2.5_confirmation_email_received.webp)

The caption is a confirmation message I received from a website hosting company 
after paying for my package using credit card. 
Note: Your payment may not go through after you put in the card details required 
from you to make payment for your domain name and hosting. You can get an error 
message. The error message can be because your card has not been verified. The 
message can be in this format: 

Fig 2.6: Error message after trying to pay for my domain hosting using card 
![ Fig 2.6: Error message after ](fig_2.6_error_message_after.webp)

To resolve the issue, the best thing is to write to their customer care. You will be 
responded to within 24 hours, but it depends on the hosting company. The cus- 
tomer care representative will guide you on what to do to resolve this. After this 
and you make another attempt to make your payment, it will go through without 
stress. If any error massage appears again, still write to them. 
 
## Conclusion 

In this chapter, I was able to guide you through on step-by-step approach on how 
to host your website or domain. By host, I mean how to pay for a name you want 
your website to answer. Also, I taught you about some website hosting companies 
that can help you with the hosting. So, you are to choose from the many listed. 
Building a website is a simple thing. If you have any question or clarification you 
want from me, do not hesitate to write to me. My email address is at the last page 
or one of the last pages of this book. 
 

# Chapter 3 Installing WordPress and Account Setup 
 

Let me throw a little light on what WordPress is before going deep on how to in- 
stall it. It will help you understand better what the content management system is. 
It will also give you knowledge on the similarity it has with other software you 
might have used in your computer or mobile phones before now. 
WordPress (WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management
system (CMS) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Fea- 
tures include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within Word- 
Press as Themes. 
Historically, the CMS was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has 
evolved to support other types of web content including more traditional mailing 
lists and forums, media galleries, membership sites, learning management sys- 
tems (LMS) and online stores. In terms of online stores, WordPress fits in properly 
in this so far you use the right theme. Using WordPress to create online Stores 
(ECommerce website is my next book after this by this author). 

Fig 3: WordPress.org logo 
![ Fig 3: WordPress.org logo ](fig_3_wordpress.org_logo.webp)

In terms of number, WordPress is used by more than 60 million websites, includ- 
ing 33.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2019. It is one of the most pop- 
ular content management system used by website builders all over the word. 
WordPress is easy to use, and it has good flexibility. Not only that, WordPress has 
many responsive themes in their system. You have thousands to choose from. It is 
your choice to select any from the many themes and start building your site from 
there. 
 
## A Step-by-step Guide on how to Install WordPress and Continue with Building of Your Website 

### Step 1: Login to Your Control Panel 

After you have finished with your payment to the domain hosting company and 
your payment confirmed and approved, you will be sent a mail to the email address 
you filled with the domain hosting company. The email will contain the details you 
need to login to the control panel of your domain. Example of the mail can be seen 
below: 

```
“ACCOUNT INFORMATION: 
==================== 
Plan: Stay Home Promotion 
Domain: teachkindle.com 
IP Address: ***.72.**5.67 
 
CPANEL LOGIN INFORMATION: 
================== 
https://webhosting34004.is.cc:9883 
Username: teacgain 
Password: ****b80* 
 
FTP INFORMATION: 
================ 
FTP (SSL/TLS available): 
***.72.**5.67 
Username: teachkin 
Password: ***L*7**” 
```

You must first click on the link in that detail. Using the sample I gave, you are to 
click on the link https://webhosting34004.is.cc:9883. The link will take you to a 
page requesting you enter the username given to you and the password also. Once 
you do that, you will be logged in to the control panel. 
Do not worry too much about what control panel is. A control panel is the adminis- 
tration portion of your webhosting account. It is an interface that you access to 
administer all the aspects of your account. Control panel of a web is like that con- 
trol panel in your laptop. It is the place where things can be changed and struc- 
tured. 
Don't be disturbed even if you do not understand the short description properly. 
What should be more important to you should be how to build a working website 
at the end of this teaching. 
With the given information, you can them login to your control panel.

Fig 3.1 What appears as you login to your website control panel. 
![ Fig 3.1 What appears as you login to your website control panel ](fig_3.1_what_appears_as.webp)

### Step 2: Install WordPress 

After you have login to the Control panel using the details given to you by the web- 
site hosting company, scroll down to the section named "SOFTACULOUS APPS 
INSTALLER". In that section, click on the WordPress symbol. 

Fig 3.2: WordPress Application in control panel 
![ Fig 3.2: WordPress Application in control panel ](fig_3.2_wordpress_application_in.webp)

When you click on “WordPress” and the application opens, scroll down and click 
on “Install now”. And once you do this a new page opens which requires you to fill 
some information. 

Fig 3.3: Click on the Install Now 
![ Fig 3.3: Click on the Install Now ](fig_3.3_click_on_the.webp)

Then fill the necessary details required from you. You must not fill in all the space, 
but the important boxes required of you to fill. 
I want to make something clear to you, in the space of "In directory" do not fill any- 
thing there. You can still read the previous sentence again. Clear that space for 
everything to be empty (do not allow any letter to be there). The reason for doing 
this is so that you install the website in the root directory of WordPress.

Fig: 3.4: Setting up WordPress (delete the “wp”) 
![ Fig: 3.4: Setting up WordPress (delete the “wp”) ](fig_3.4_setting_up_wordpress.webp)

Using the caption, you are to delete the “wp” and then leave the box empty. 
Fill in the right information in the other boxes provided for you: 

### Site Settings Section 

In the "Site Name" fill the name you want your website to answer. Using my own 
domain name which we have been using in this teaching, I can decide to fill my 
own "Site Name" as "Tech Kindle" or "Teach Kindle". The name to give the website 
is my choice. 
But you can decide to change this name anytime you feel like doing so. That is the 
flexibility in building website. The only thing you cannot change is that website link 
(URL) which website hosting company gave you at hosting. For example, I cannot 
change my website (domain name) link www.teachkindle.com. It is permanent. It 
has been registered on the web worldwide. 
In the "Site Description" you are required to describe your website shortly. So, 
delete that "My WordPress Blog" already put in the space by default and put few 
words that will tell people what your website is all about. Using my own website 
"teachkindle.com" I can input "All About Learning Website Building". When I have 
this in my description, it will send signal to visitors on what my website is all about 
whenever they visit. 
For "Enable Multisite (WPMU)" do not tick the box. You are to leave it as it is. 
 
### Admin Account 

In this section, you are required to fill in the name you will be known with on the 
website or as you login to your WordPress account after the final setup, password 
to be used to login to your WordPress, and email address to be used to receive
email news and notifications from them. 
In the "Admin Username" you can type in your real name. You can also type in any 
name you like to answer. 
I believe you have visited any website whereby you were shown the publisher's 
name on top of the page. The reason why that name shows as that is because that 
name was chosen as the admin name in a website run by a single person. In my 
own case, I can choose to put "William S. Page" as my "Admin Username". 
In the " Admin Password " you are to fill in the password you will use to login into 
your site after setup. The password should be strong and should not be easily pre- 
dicted by people. Please do not use your date of birth as your password. Also do 
not use your mobile phone number either. 
Use a password that cannot be easily broken by hackers. You can write it down and 
put in a place you know people will not see it. Even if you forget your password 
tomorrow, you can reset it and a link to do that will be sent to your working email 
address. 
For the "Admin Email" please do not use the email address already generated by 
WordPress system there. Do not make that mistake. In the caption, you can see 
"admin@teachkindle.com" in that space filled in already. That was autogenerated. 
So, I will not use it. I didn't create any email like that. 

Fig 3.5: The autogenerated email address 
![ Fig 3.5: The autogenerated email address ](fig_3.5_the_autogenerated_email.webp)

Edit that email generated by the system and put your active email address. You can 
put your Gmail, Yahoomail, Hotmail, or any other email you make use of. It must 
not be a custom email. WordPress need that email to notify you of any changes or 
important news you need to know about their products. The admin section should 
not be played with as that can be used to help you recover your account if issues 
arise. 
In the choose language section, just choose the language you want your website to 
be written in. There are many language options on WordPress. As of May 2020, 
there are 37 language options available in WordPress. Among these languages is 
English, Spanish, Chinese, German, Italian, Dutch, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Danish, 
Finnish, French, Croatian, Portuguese, Hungarian language and others. 

### Manage Plugin Sets

For this section, do not tamper with anything there. Just leave it as it is. When we 
are done with the installation of the WordPress, we can manage plugins from its 
Dashboard. So, do not tick anything on "login Limit Attempts (Loginizer)", "Clas- 
sic Editor" and "wpCentral - Manage Multiple WordPres". 

### Advanced Options 

In the "Advanced Options" section, do not change anything there. Leave those op- 
tions the way they are. With time when you master website building properly, you 
can make changes you want. 

## Stage 3: Theme Selection 

There are many themes you can select in WordPress before you finally complete 
your installation. It is your choice to choose from the Plenty available themes. 
Themes give your website the beauty it is required to have. 
In the "Select Theme" section, you are expected to make your selection. If the one 
you want to use does not appear first, click on the arrow pointing towards the right 
to see other themes. Keep on going until you see the them you feel will fit the web- 
site you want to build. But if you do not see any which you have in mind, do not 
worry because you will be exposed to more themes in WordPress admin area after 
installation. 

Fig 3.6: Arrow shows where to click when your choice of theme does not appear first 
![ Fig 3.6: Arrow shows where to click when your choice of theme does not appear first ](fig_3.6_arrow_shows_where.webp)

Also, if you already have the name of a WordPress theme you want to use, you can 
use the theme search box to search. Just put the name of the theme and hit search. 
The theme will pop up and you select it.


Fig 3.7: When you click on the search, a window will pop up and you type the name of the theme 
![ Fig 3.7: When you click on the search, a window will pop up and you type the name of the theme ](fig_3.7_when_you_click.webp)

Check through all the information you filled in the WordPress installation page. If 
you will forget your password or the email address you used in your WordPress, 
you can write them down or save them in any cloud application you make use of. 
When you are sure that everything you filled is in order, there is something more 
you need to do before you hit install. At the bottom of the page, look very well and 
you will see "Email Installation Details to". In that box, fill in your email address 
you want WordPress to send your installation details to. 

Fig 3.8: Type in your functioning email address there
![ Fig 3.8: Type in your functioning email address there ](fig_3.8_type_in_your.webp)

When I built my first website, I forgot to fill that space. I waited for long expecting 
WordPress to send any installation details to my email address, but it didn't come. 
I later uninstalled the WordPress and reinstalled a new one filling everything cor- 
rectly, that was when I got the details from them. 
Installation details contains some information. The information is: 

- Your website Path 
- Your website URL 
- Admin URL 
- Admin Username 
- Admin Password 
- Admin Email 
- MySQL Database 
- MySQL DB User 
- MySQL DB Host 
- MySQL DB Password 
- Update Notification : Enabled or Disabled 
- Auto Upgrade : Enabled or Disabled 
- Automated Backups : Enabled or Disabled 
- Time of Installation 

When you have verified every information, you have entered and then select install, 
the page loads and the installation is completed. Below is the similar page you will 
see: 

Fig 3.9: Picture shows next page that appears after installation 
![ Fig 3.9: Picture shows next page that appears after installation ](fig_3.9_picture_shows_next.webp)

I used the word “similar” because my domain name is different from the one you 
will be using. As my own domain name is different and unique, that is why my 
administrative URL is unique. 
You may ask what URL is? URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is just a 
website link. In this sample, my administrative URL is https://teachkindle.com/ 
wp-admin/ once I type that in any browser, I can input my username and
password, and login to my admin area. 
So, for your own, once you installed WordPress after you have filled the necessary 
information required of you, your own admin URL will be https://your domain 
name/wp-admin/. Let us say your domain name is "uniquefood" your admin URL 
will be https://uniquefood.com/wp-admin/. 
 
## What will You do if After Installation Your Website does not Load? 

It is expected that once you put your email address where your installation details 
are to be sent and then hit "Install" and the installation is successful, your website 
suppose to start working immediately. If you visit www.mywebsite.com at that 
point, it supposes to load and open a new page. 
If I visit my website www.teachkindle.com immediately after the installation is com- 
pleted, it supposes to load just as I have in the picture: 

Fig 3.1.1: Homepage of my newly created website
![ Fig 3.1.1: Homepage of my newly created website ](fig_3.1.1_homepage_of_my.webp)

## What to do when Your Newly Created Website does not Load 

If after the WordPress installation and your website does not load or you receive 
error message, there is something you can do. Without wasting much time, visit 
the website of the domain hosting company where you hosted your website. 
Login in, and then write to them concerning the issue. They will respond to you 
within minutes on what caused the issue. At the end it will be resolved. Sometimes 
such issue occurs because the site has not been verified. 
When I hosted my site teachkindle.com with Inter Server and installed WordPress 
for the site building, I got an error message when I visited that my website. I re- 
freshed the page many times and the error message kept coming. 
I then logged in to Inter Server website and sent mail to them. They responded to 
me within few minutes explaining the cause of the error. I was instructed to verify 
my new domain that it is a rule from ICANN before my website would work. I did 
that and my website started loading fine. 
Below is the message I got from my hosting company (Inter Server) on the issue: 

```
"** Please note that failure to complete the process outlined below will lead to the 
suspension of your domain name. ** 
 
Dear Customer, 
 
Please read this important e-mail carefully. 
 
Recently you registered, transferred or modified the contact information for one or 
more of your domain name(s). ICANN requires all accredited registrars to verify 
your new contact information. You can read about ICANN's new policy at: http:// 
www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/raa/approved-with-specs-27jun13- 
en.ht-m#whois-accu-racy. 
 
teachkindle.com 

In order to ensure your domain name remain active, you must now click the fol- 
lowing link and follow the instructions provided: 
 
http://approve.domainadmin.com/registrant/?veri-fication_id=108-92562&key=eUnUzd-WKRy&rid=2833 
 
Failure to follow the above link and complete this process will eventually lead to 
the suspension of your domain name(s). 
 
If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch. 
 
Thank you for your attention, 
InterServer Inc" 
```
 

# Chapter 4 WordPress Admin Dashboard and the Features 
 

In this chapter, I will be explaining WordPress administrator dashboard and its
features to you before we continue with practical approaches in the next chapters. 
It will help you understand how to use each tool in the dashboard. It is something 
you should not jump. 
The WordPress admin dashboard, often called WP Admin or WP admin panel, is 
essentially the control panel for your entire WordPress website. It’s where you cre- 
ate and manage content, add functionality in the form of plugins, change styling in 
the form of themes, and lots, lots more. 

Fig 4: My WordPress admin dashboard
![ Fig 4: My WordPress admin dashboard ](fig_4_my_wordpress_admin.webp)

In fact, dashboard is the inner room where products are made before they are 
brought out to the public to buy. It is where things are built before they are made 
public for readers to see. Dashboard is like a chamber where things are first 
planned, executed before the result is shown to the people to see or analyze. Even 
when it is shown to the people and the people said it is not good, you can go back 
to that inner chamber which is the dashboard and change things to be better be- 
fore they go public again. 
In chapter 3, I taught you how to set up WordPress. At the end of that chapter, I in- 
structed you on how you can choose any theme before you can click install for 
everything to be completed. 
But do you know what? Those things irrespective of the fact that they are many are 
not up to what WordPress has in their database when you finally install your web- 
site with them. What I mean is that when you login to WordPress using the link 
https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/, example using mine https:// 
teachkindle.com/wp-admin/, in the theme section, there are many other themes 
available there. That is why you can choose any theme of your choice as you go on 
with your design irrespective of the theme you selected when you first did the in- 
stallation through control panel. 
 
## The Features of WordPress Admin Dashboard 

The features of WordPress admin dashboard are as follow: 

- Update tab 
- Post 
- Media 
- Pages 
- Comments 
- Appearance 
- Plugins 
- Users 
- Tools and 
- Settings 

### Update 

The update bar shows notifications if there is any software in the system that needs 
to be updated. It was created by WordPress software developers to always keep the 
content management system (WordPress) alive. When there is any notification on 
the update bar and the admin installs such update, it makes the system works in a 
more efficient way. You can choose to make the update automatic or manual. 
The Dashboard Updates Screen provides the links necessary to install a ‘core’ 
WordPress upgrade automatically, or to download the file necessary to complete a 
manual upgrade. In addition to the ‘core’ update process, this Screen provides the 
ability to upgrade all plugins and themes, active or inactive, that have available up- 
dates. 

### Posts 

Post is the body of any website. Post as a feature of WordPress dashboard is where 
contents of a site are constructed and published for visitors to the site to come and 
read. 
When posts bar is clicked on, it opens another interface where an admin to the
website can type words that he wants to tell the whole world. It is like Microsoft 
Word we use in our computers. 
Posts is a center where you can construct any blog posts of your choice when you 
select "add post" after clicking on the "Post". It is an important tool. 
With the help of Posts icon, you can see the titles you have published on your web- 
site also. Through such icon, you can still edit some already published articles on 
the web. Maybe you want to add more content to your already published titles, you 
first select post before you continue with the function. 
Through the post icon, you can still create category. Category helps administrators 
of websites to arrange articles in different groups. I know you have visited websites 
where you have categories like " Sports", "Entertainment", "Politics", "Health", and 
"Education". Such categorization is created through the "Post" icon in WordPress 
sites. 

Fig 4.1: How WordPress category looks like when selected through “Posts” 
![ Fig 4.1: How WordPress category looks like when selected through “Posts” ](fig_4.1_how_wordpress_category.webp)

Also, website menus can be created through category. We will discuss more on 
this later in this book. 

### Media 

Media is a dashboard screen option that can be used to save any video or pictures. 
Maybe you were browsing through any website and came across any fine picture 
you like, and you felt that picture will be good for some articles you will write in
future, you can download the picture in your computer or phone first. 
Later when you are less busy, you then upload the picture to your WordPress 
media. Once the image is there, it is safe. It is like uploading any file to a cloud. So, 
any time you publish any article that will be suitable for the image, you then select 
media library and select the picture and have it in the part of the article you want. 
Media has two options when selected. There is "Library" and "Add New". In the li- 
brary, you have already uploaded pictures and videos. And in the Add New you se- 
lect it to upload more videos and images. 

Fig 4.2a: Screenshot showing “Library” and “Add New” option of “Media”
![ Fig 4.2a: Screenshot showing “Library” and “Add New” option of “Media” ](fig_4.2a_screenshot_showing_library.webp)

The " Library " option usually comes with already uploaded images integrated into 
the system by the developer of the theme in use on the website. This is a new 
development as it was not like that before. But some developers may decide not to 
have any images or videos integrated into their theme. Astra theme for example 
come with nice pictures stored in the library. You can see it in the screenshot. 

Fig 4.2b: Screenshot showing already uploaded images in the “Library” option 
[ Fig 4.2b: Screenshot showing already uploaded images in the “Library” option ](fig_4.2b_screenshot_showing_already.webp)

Those pictures came with the theme currently in use in this my site. There are 
many stock images but I captured just fewer number of them. 

### Pages 

In WordPress, you can put content on your site as either a “post” or a “page”. 
When you’re writing a regular blog entry, you write a post. Posts, in a default setup, 
appear in reverse chronological order on your blog’s homepage. 
In contrast, pages are for non-chronological content: pages like “About” or “Con- 
tact” would be common examples. Pages live outside of the normal blog chronol- 
ogy and are often used to present timeless information about yourself or your site
— information that is always relevant. You can use Pages to organize and manage 
the structure of your website content. 
Looking at the current homepage of my website www.teachkindle.com as shown in 
the picture below, the menu items Home, About, Services, Projects, and Contact 
are formed through "Pages" screen option. 

Fig 4.3: Homepage of teachkindle.com showing menu items of the website formed from pages 
![ Fig 4.3: Homepage of teachkindle.com showing menu items of the website formed from pages ](fig_4.3_homepage_of_teachkindle.webp)

When you click on any of the tabs, it will open and shows you the content it is 
made up of. This content can still be changed any time you want to do so. One of 
the ways you can do that is to login to your WordPress admin area. At the pages 
screen option, just click on it and then, select pages. Select any of the pages you 
want to edit and then make the necessary changes. 
Through “Pages”, you can even delete any of the tabs you do not like. The step is to 
login to your WordPress site, select "Pages", then "All Pages" take your cursor to 
the page you want to delete and hover around it, and under it you will see "Trash". 
Select the “Trash” and then the page becomes deleted from the system.

Fig 4.4: How to delete any page from a website 
![ Fig 4.4: How to delete any page from a website ](fig_4.4_how_to_delete.webp)

There are two components of "Pages" in the WordPress dashboard. They are "View 
Pages" and "Add New". With " View Pages" you can see all the pages that exist on 
your website and with "Add New" you add new pages on your website. 

### Comments 

In comments screen option, you can see comments any reader wrote under your 
published articles on your website. But Comment can be disabled depending on 
the choice of the admin. Comment feature also allows you to moderate the com- 
ments on your posts. If any reader gives negative comment, you can decide to 
delete such comment through this link. 
Also, if you see some good comments which you believe will help other visitors 
read more of your other posts, you can also approve such comment through the 
"Comments" screen option. It is a chamber for moderation of comments. 
Sometimes, spam comments are pushed into comment section of every post 
administrators publish. To limit this from happening or going public, it can be 
regulated through Comments option in the dashboard. It is a good feature of every 
content management system used in building websites. 
In the Comments screen option, you can also search any comment people posted 
some time ago. Maybe you want to check something in that comment or respond 
to the reader before, but you haven't done that, it is important you do so. You can 
search for the person’s name and you will find out the post he commented on.

Fig 4.5: Picture showing the search box of the Comments screen 
![ Fig 4.5: Picture showing the search box of the Comments screen ](fig_4.5_picture_showing_the.webp)

When you find that out, you then visit your website and search for the post. Seeing 
the post, you scroll down to find his or her comment, click on reply and then re- 
spond. 

### Appearance 

The appearance screen option plays important role on websites. The Appearance 
Themes Screen allows you to manage your Themes. That means you can install, 
preview, delete, activate, and update themes through Appearance. 
A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graph- 
ical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called 
template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying 
the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image 
files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary 
code files (*.php). 
The components of Appearance screen option are Themes, Customize, Widgets, 
Menus, Starter Templates, and Theme Editor. In the caption you will see “Astra Op- 
tions” but I did not include it among the components. The reason is because I 
have already installed Astra Theme before the caption. So, it is not one of the major 
components of Appearance. It is dependent on my theme in use. 

Fig 4.6: Picture shows the components of Appearance screen option 
![ Fig 4.6: Picture shows the components of Appearance screen option ](fig_4.6_picture_shows_the.webp)

### Plugins 

Plugins are software used to improve the functionality of any website. A plugin is a 
piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a Word- 
Press website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your Word- 
Press websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language 
and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. 
As a prospective website builder, there are many things you can use Plugins Screen 
option to do. Example is to add social media link to your website. You can click on 
the Plugins tab, and then search for the plugin you want to use.
Plugin is made up of three components. The components are Installed Plugins, 
Add New and Plugin Editor. The `Installed Plugins` when selected shows the list of 
plugins already running in the system. The `Add New` is selected when you want to 
add new plugins to WordPress. And the `Plugin Editor` contains the codes that 
makes the Plugins work. 
If you do not know the exact name of the software/plugin that you can use to link 
to your social media platforms, typing the term "social media" can give you lists of 
plugins designed by different developers. At that state you will make choice of the 
one you want to use. 

Fig 4.7: Search for social media plugin using keyword 
![ Fig 4.7: Search for social media plugin using keyword ](fig_4.7_search_for_social.webp)

Maybe you saw one social media icon on one person’s website, and you like it, if 
you are told the name of the developer of that particular social media plugin, you 
can just search using the name of the developer or author and the plugins software 
designed by the developer will pop up. All you are to do is to select the option to 
search using “Author” and type in the name. 
At that state, you can look and see the one that is for social media and select it. In- 
stall it and then active it. From there you follow the guide of the developer on how 
to make it work on your website. 
Sometimes when you select Plugins screen option, it shows you some suggested 
plugins it feels is needed by your site. It is optional to whether you want to install 
and active them or not. So, if such suggestions show up, you decide what to do. 

### Users 

Users screen option on a dashboard plays the role of keeping the number of admi- 
nistrators that operate the website. Sometimes in big media companies, they utilize 
WordPress Users properly. It allows them to add persons that can cover a different 
genre published on the website. 
Maybe William is good at Education topics, he is created as a user to publish 
education articles. And if Smart is good at tech topics, he is added as a user to 
handle and write in that area. This makes good websites to have more contents on 
their websites and build more readers. 
 
They can be in their respective areas and do their publications. This is because 
once they are created, they are given access to login to the site dashboard and 
make their publication. They are given passwords and usernames to login. 
Also, sometimes editors are added. The function of the editor is to quickly edit any
work written by any user. Once the editing is completed, he goes on and publish 
the article. 
Creating users in WordPress allows you to add people with different roles, and ac- 
cess privileges to your site. Once created, a user will be able to log in to your site 
with a username and password. WordPress user roles include site administrator, 
editor, author, contributor and subscriber. 
Editors screen option adds dynamism to WordPress sites. It is a welcomed feature 
added by WordPress. This has lessened the burden of having one person do all the 
publishing work by companies. It also encourages division of labor as certain tasks 
are divided among members. With this feature, everyone participates in making 
works done easily. 
Editors have its components as "All Users", "Add New" and "Your Profile". With all 
users, you can see the number of users that are already existing on the website. It 
also shows the individual email addresses of all the users, the number of posts 
they have published and their profiles. You can add your profile picture through 
this link. 

Fig 4. 8: Pictures showing the components of Users screen option 
![ Fig 4. 8: Pictures showing the components of Users screen option ](fig_4._8_pictures_showing_the.webp)

With Add New, you can add any person you want to welcome into the team. The 
person may have his already existing website but wants to work on your website as 
a contributor. The information to fill when you are adding a new user are User- 
name, Email, First Name, Last Name, Website of the user if any, Password, Send 
User Notification, Role. Role defines what the new user is going to be working as. 
As of the time of publication of this book, the roles available are Subscriber, Con- 
tributor, Author, Editor and Administrator. 
In the Profile tab, it allows the user to build his profile. Through this link, a user de- 
cides on whether to have picture in his profile or not, whether he wants to change 
the name that appears public to readers or not and to tell people a little about his 
person. 
Through Profile link, the user decides whether to create new password different
from the one he or she uses to login to the site. It is an optional thing. But if he 
does not want any new password, he can continue with the one he uses to login. 
Building websites with WordPress makes it easy for you to do many things as a 
builder. If in the long run a user decides to leave the team of users, it is possible. 
The administrator can remove you from the list of users. 

### Tools 

Tools has special functionality that makes WordPress websites complete. Tools is 
a menu tab in the WordPress admin sidebar. It contains tools to perform some 
non-routine management tasks. 
Tools are made up of few other components for performing specific tasks. The 
components are "Available Tools", "Import", "Export", "Site Health", "Export Per- 
sonal Data", and "Erase Personal Data". Each of these links is used to complete a 
specific task. 

Fig 4. 9: Tools screen option and its components 
![ Fig 4. 9: Tools screen option and its components ](fig_4._9_tools_screen_option.webp)

With Available Tools, you can view some of the tools you have already installed 
into the system from outside the WordPress. If you have not imported any files 
from outside WordPress before, this link will be empty and will not show any re- 
port when you select it. 
Import allows you to import files from other content management systems like 
Google Blogger and Live Journal. The import tool contains scripts to import data 
from other Content Management Systems into WordPress. 
Take for example you have some nice posts you published on Google Blogger and 
now you want to publish them in your newly hosted site with WordPress, this im- 
port tab can help you achieve that. Instead of doing copy and paste, Import tool 
makes it easy for you. 
The export tool allows users to export WordPress data in XML format which can 
later be imported into another WordPress installation. The format is called a Word- 
Press eXtended RSS or WXR file. It will contain all your posts, comments, custom 
fields, categories, and tags. Exporting your content is a useful way to back up your 
WordPress website. 
Site Health tab tells you how healthy your website is. It shows whether your site is 
in a good state or in a critical condition. Honestly this is a new feature developed 
by WordPress and it has really helped administrators maintain the health state of 
their websites. 
With this tool, you are informed on the plugins in your site that need to be re- 
moved or made inactive. These plugins are mainly those ones that are not in use. 
In the other words, they are occupying space. 
Site Health tool also informs you of the themes that you are not using on your
website and hence they are still active in the background of your website. Some of 
the themes are those you have used before but later you decided to install another 
theme and start using that new theme. Site Health encourages you should deac- 
tivate such themes that are no longer in use. It encourages that you should remove 
such inactive theme. A link is usually provided for you to do that immediately to 
improve the health of your website. 
If your WordPress site is running outdated PHP version, Site Health tool will let 
you know. It can detail out reasons you need to upgrade. Also, it can give you a di- 
rect link for the upgrade. 
Export Personal Data involves personal request. With the changes and focus on 
privacy in the internet, WordPress has taken steps to allow for users of your Word- 
Press site to be able to request the removal of their personal data. The added inter- 
face allows for the administrator to request a confirmation for data export and re- 
moval. 
Erase Personal Data is a newly added tool component by WordPress. WordPress 
4.9.6 included a feature to delete a user’s personal data upon verified request. 
Deleted data is permanently removed from the database. Erasure requests cannot 
be reversed after they have been confirmed. 

### Settings 

Settings Screen option records the settings of your entire website. It shows the set- 
tings that affects you as the user and the one that affects that of your readers also. 
From settings, you can change any permission you do not like about your website. 
The Sittings include General, Writing, Reading, Discussion, Media, Permalinks and 
Privacy Settings. In General, you have your website name, Website URL, descrip- 
tion, time zone of the site, date and time format, Administrator's email, new sub- 
scribers, membership, the website language and usage tracking. 

Fig 4.1.1: Settings screen option 
![ Fig 4.1.1: Settings screen option ](fig_4.1.1_settings_screen_option.webp)

The Writing shows settings on how you write while the Reading is settings con- 
cerning what people read on your website. For the Reading settings, you set the 
number of posts you want to appear on your landing page, whether latest posts are 
to show first on your landing page or not and whether search engine should dis- 
cover your website or not. Example of Search engine is Google. 
In the Discussion settings, you set how you want people to discuss about your
posts through comments section. You set whether you have to approve some com- 
ments before they go public or not, the maximum number of comments to be 
shown on each post, whether readers should fill their names and email before they 
comment and whether avatar are to be used to show readers that comment on your 
posts. 
In Media settings, the admin shows the dimensions and size of images to be up- 
loaded to the site. He also instructs the system on how images and videos to be 
uploaded to the site are organized. 
Permalinks settings is all about the links on the site. It sets how the links to posts 
published on the site should be modeled. For example, date and name can be used 
to structure the link. Example, if I am to publish a tile "Web Design" in my website 
www.teachkindle.com, the link to the article using the given format will be like 
https://teachkindle.com/2020/05/31/web-design/. 
Privacy settings allows you to set privacy policy on your website. As a website 
owner, you may need to follow national or international privacy laws. For example, 
you may need to create and display a Privacy Policy. 
 

# Chapter 5 New Theme Installation 

 
In chapter 2 and 3, they were all pure practical teaching. I took you on step-by-step 
guide on how to host a website with any hosting company of your choice and on 
how to set up WordPress Content Management System. Those teachings were well 
detailed out for your proper comprehension and I believe you understood them. 
Please do not hesitate to write to me through my email which is at the end of this 
book if you have any challenge. I am here to help you build and design your own 
website. I feel happy to teach people on what they do not know because skills are 
very important for humans growth and development. 
In chapter 4, I explained the features of WordPress dashboard for you. That was 
not a pure practical class. I did that because I want you to know the functions of 
each screen option. I also want you to be properly equipped and get use to those 
tabs. 
In this chapter, we will be entering another pure practical section as we did in chap- 
ter 2 and 3. I will be teaching you on sound dynamic theme you have to use to 
build your website easily and give it stunning design. So many things have changed 
in the world of website building and design over the years, and I put those changes 
into consideration before giving you this teaching. You will learn something great 
from this chapter and it will bring enlightenment to your desire to design websites. 
 
## Installation of New Theme 

After you are done with setting up and installation of your WordPress through your 
control panel as we discussed in chapter 3, the next is to login into your WordPress 
site. As earlier said, you will be given a login URL (example https:// 
teachkindle.com/wp-admin/) and when you enter the link in a browser, you are to 
insert your username or your email address and the password you used when set- 
ting up WordPress through your control panel, then hit login.

Fig 5: Logging in to WordPress 
![ Fig 5: Logging in to WordPress ](fig_5_logging_in_to.webp)

When you are done logging in to your WordPress site, the next thing you will see is 
your dashboard. It displays many screen options/tabs for specific functions. 
You are to then install a new theme that will help us build a complete website of 
good standard. In this teaching, we will start by using a theme “Astra” to build our 
website. But we will change it later in the teaching. It is one of the most popular 
themes used by Website builders to build their websites in the recent time. You 
can decide to choose your own theme, but I will be teaching you with Astra first. 

## Installation of theme Astra 

### Step 1: Search and Install the Theme 

As you login to your WordPress, you will be taken to the dashboard homepage. At 
the right-hand side, you will see some screen options. Scroll down and select `Appearance`. As you select `Appearance`, it will display some other options. So, select 
`Themes` among those optionally.

Fig 5.1: Choosing Theme option for new theme installation 
![ Fig 5.1: Choosing Theme option for new theme installation ](fig_5.1_choosing_theme_option.webp)

As you select the Themes sub screen option, a new page will open. On top of the 
page you will see "Add New". Click on the Add new and a search box will be shown 
to you. Also, you will be shown many available themes in WordPress. In the search 
box, just type the word "Astra". 

Fig 5.2: Searching for Theme Astra using theme search box 
![ Fig 5.2: Searching for Theme Astra using theme search box ](fig_5.2_searching_for_theme.webp)

From the screenshot, you are to select the first theme. That is the one that has 
“TODAY IS A GREAT DAY!” written on its header. That is what we will be working 
with. 
After you are done installing the theme known as Astra, the next thing is to activate 
it. If you do not activate the theme, it will not work on your website. So, take your 
mouse pointer/cursor up or your finger and hit activate depending on the kind of 
device you are using.

Fig 5.3: Activating Astra theme after searching through the box 
![ Fig 5.3: Activating Astra theme after searching through the box ](fig_5.3_activating_astra_theme.webp)

Once the activation is done, then you are a little bit good to go. The system will in- 
struct you in some cases to install some other software (plugins) to help the func- 
tionality of the theme. But if it does not, do not disturb yourself because I am here 
to help you. 
 
### Step 2: Installation of Plugin 

As we have installed and activated the Astra theme, the next thing is to install the 
plugin that will help us work with the Astra theme. This gives us additional func- 
tionality to do what we want to do. 
Go to the dashboard homepage, then click on `plugins`. Among the sub options 
that shows when you clicked on the plugin in, select "`Add New`". A new page 
opens for you to search for the plugins you want to install. 
In the Plugins search box, search for Astra. When it shows up, click on it, install 
and activate it. Astra plugin works with the theme. 

Fig 5.4: Installation of Astra plugin 
![ Fig 5.4: Installation of Astra plugin ](fig_5.4_installation_of_astra.webp)

### Step 3: Choosing a Design 

Astra plugin comes with a set of designs. These designs are so many that you are 
left with a lot of choices on the one to use. Astra is well built with stunning and 
stock designs. Some of the templates are free while some others are not. 
To see and make your choice from these designs, from the dashboard screen
options, select Plugins and then click on Installed Plugins. You will see the list of 
installed plugins in your dashboard. Scroll down, and you will see the one named 
"`Starter Templates`". Under the "`Starter Templates`" you will see "See Library". 

Fig 5.5: Step to choose design from the installed Astra plugin
![ Fig 5.5: Step to choose design from the installed Astra plugin ](fig_5.5_step_to_choose.webp)

Click on the "`See Library`" and a new page will open showing different designs. At 
this point you are left with the option to choose any design. 

### Step 4: Selecting Page Builder 

In step 3, we ended at clicking on "See Library" to select designs of your choice 
which can be achieved using any page builder software of Astra. As you click on the 
"See Library", you will be shown some page builders. 
These page builders are Elementor, Breaver Builder, Gutenberg and Brizy. Without 
much stress, just select Elementor. 

Fig 5.6: Selecting Elementor page builder after clicking on “See Library” 
![ Fig 5.6: Selecting Elementor page builder after clicking on “See Library” ](fig_5.6_selecting_elementor_page.webp)

With the selection of this Elementor page builder, website building and design is 
made easy for us. It gives us flexibility to make edit of any text and images and we 
see how they change immediately at the landing page of our website. Not only 
landing page because you can select any page through menu and see how the 
changes occur as you edit.

Fig 5.7: Next page showing different designs when Elementor is chosen 
![ Fig 5.7: Next page showing different designs when Elementor is chosen ](fig_5.7_next_page_showing.webp)

Out of those designs that will show up when you choose Elementor, you can 
choose any of them that you feel will be okay for your website. I want to bring to 
your notice that any of the designs tagged “Agency” are not free. So, choose any of 
the designs without that tag. 
When you select any theme (a design) you will be shown how that design will look 
on your website. If you like the look, you can go on and install the it. But if you do 
not like it, you can go back to the previous page and then choose another design. 
You can continue until you get your taste. 
Once you are okay with the one you found at last, you can use it to change the look 
of your website. This can apply to all your entire website or just the homepage of 
your website. It is your choice to make. I will tell you how. The reason is because 
there are options for you on where you want the design to make remarkable 
change. There is "`Import Complete Site`" and "`Import Home`" Template options. 

Fig 5.8: Choosing where you want your chosen design make changes
![ Fig 5.8: Choosing where you want your chosen design make changes ](fig_5.8_choosing_where_you.webp)

At this point let’s work with making changes at the complete site entirely. So, select 
"Import Complete Site". This will help us to design our entire site including the 
homepage with Astra theme with changes applying to other arears of the website. 
After selecting that option, there will be a pop up asking you to do the installation 
of the option you chose. Just go on with the installation. Once you complete the 
task, you will see a congratulatory message on your screen. 

Fig 5.9: When you succeeded in importing the theme 
![ Fig 5.9: When you succeeded in importing the theme ](fig_5.9_when_you_succeeded.webp)

At this point, you can visit your website homepage and see the remarkable beau- 
tiful change on it. You will see nice background and other nice pictures. We will 
continue from next chapter.


# Chapter 6 Header and Landing Page Top Design 


This is another practical section of this book. In Chapter 5, we discussed how to in- 
stall new theme and plugins that will make our design smooth and sound. 
In this chapter, we are entering the real design of the header section of the website. 
Also, to be learnt is how to design the top part of the landing page of any website. 
If you visit www.teachkindle.com or any other active website for instance, the first 
page you will be shown is the landing page of the website. I will walk you through 
and help you on how to get the job done. At the end of this chapter, you will be 
happy that you bought this book. That which seemed to be something big to you 
as if you could not do it will be simplified. 
Maybe you use to visit some websites before and you observed that every week, the 
header sections of the websites do change, at a point you began to ask yourself on 
how these things were done. It appeared as if it is something impossible for you to 
do. 
You will find out today that there is nothing impossible to do about that. It is a 
simple task to complete once you learn the skill. And that skill you will learn 
through this chapter. 
 
## What is a Website Header 

A website header is the top section of the web page. A website header sits at the 
top of each page and serves a few very important purposes. This does more than 
provide a place for your logo; it is part of a consistent user experience that all good 
websites share. The design of header varies from one website to the other. 
Back in the day, people understood headers as narrow strips in the top parts of the 
websites that contained a logo, a call to action, and contact information. But in 
modern design, the whole space above the fold of the homepage is considered a 
header. 
Being the strategic part of the page that people see in the first seconds of loading a 
website, a header acts as a kind of invitation. It should provide basic information 
about a site so that users can understand what it offers in seconds.

Fig 6: Header section of teachkindle.com after installation of Astra Theme and Plugin 
![ Fig 6: Header section of teachkindle.com after installation of Astra Theme and Plugin ](fig_6_header_section_of.webp)

From the screenshot, you can see the header section of my newly hosted website, 
teachkindle.com, which we have been using in this teaching. In the menu items, we 
have Home, About, Services, and Contact. These tabs are part of the header sec- 
tion of the site. 
Also, by the right is the website logo bearing “MOUNTAIN”. In this chapter, we will 
redesign the header and add any content we want it to possess. It is a technical ap- 
proach that you will learn through this chapter of this book. 
 
## Practical: How to Design the Menu Items 

You can call it menu items or menu bar. Note that this teaching is on accordance 
with the fact that you have been following my guide starting from the chapter one 
of this book. This teaching is centered on the fact that you have installed Astra 
theme and Astra plugin in your WordPress or any other theme. 
It is important to know that there are other approaches you can use to design the 
menu of your website. But the approach am going to teach you with seems to be 
simple because of my experience in website building. You will be happy at the end. 
 
### How to Design the "Home" Menu Bar 

If the Home menu bar is not existing in the Astra theme you have installed and 
activated, then you are to set it up. You are to put it in the menu. 
To do this, login to your WordPress account, select Appearance and then Cus- 
tomize. 

Fig 6.1: Setting up “Home” menu bar 
![ Fig 6.1: Setting up “Home” menu bar ](fig_6.1_setting_up_home.webp)

When you click on Customize, a new page will open. In that opened page, select 
menu and the Navigation (note that we use select and click to mean the same thing 
in this teaching). As you select Navigation, you will be shown the existing menu 
items on the website.

Fig 6.2: Showing Navigation Menu and how to add new menu 
![ Fig 6.2: Showing Navigation Menu and how to add new menu ](fig_6.2_showing_navigation_menu.webp)

In the screenshot, the home menus item has already existed, but let us assume it 
does not exist, what you will do is to click on “Add Items”. When you click on it, 
you will be shown some pages, posts, and category items. So, you have to select 
any of them, and it is added to the menu.

Fig 6.3: Selecting your Home menu bar from Pages 
![ Fig 6.3: Selecting your Home menu bar from Pages ](fig_6.3_selecting_your_home.webp)

From that caption, you are to click on the Home as indicated by the arrow. Once 
you do that, the Home will be added among the menu items. The next is to click on 
publish as shown on top of the page. One you do this; your change will be pub- 
lished on the Home menu bar of your website. 
If the Home menu item you want to add is not existing as page, post or category, 
you then have to go back to your WordPress dashboard, create a new page called 
Home, put some contents in the home which you want visitors to see when they 
visit your Home menu bar and then hit publish. 
As you do this, what it means is that you have created a page called home. So, you 
go and repeat the process I taught you before. That is Appearance>Customize>- 
Menu>Navigation and then select that page you created titled “Home” and then 
you add it to Menu. 
It is a simple task. There is sometimes no straight formula to get to a design ap- 
proach. What is more important is to get the basics. As this is done, you will get 
use to the system as you practice repeatedly. Do not forget to write to me if you 
have any form of difficulty as you proceed. I am your teacher for now. 
 
## Designing the content of Website Home Menus using Elementor 

I know you will like to have a Home that looks good and attracting. We are going to 
design this menu item to this standard. As I earlier said, some Astra themes and 
plugins come with already established homepage. The Homepage menu bar most 
times do not come with the content that describes what your website is all about. 
Example is the one seen in the website I am using to teach you this website build- 
ing.

The Home menu content was written in both English and French languages. It was 
left for me to change this language to my own taste. The same thing will apply to 
your own so far you are making use of Astra theme and plugins. 
 
### Step 1: Login 

To start the practical approach in changing this, login to your WordPress. This is 
the first step you must take because if you do not do it there is no way you can 
make any change. As you have done this, open a new tab in the same browser you 
are using to do this design. Type in the URL of your website in the newly opened 
tab (example www.teachkindle.com). 

Fig 6.4: Teachkindle.com landing page 
![ Fig 6.4: Teachkindle.com landing page ](fig_6.4_teachkindle.com_landing.webp)

Click on your Home menu item. Allow it to load. Look on top of the Home and you 
will see a bar titled “Edit with Elementor”. Click on that “Edit with Elementor”. As 
you do so, a new page will open. Click on any written word, phrase, clause or sen- 
tence on the Home and add your own words. You can even delete any words you 
do not want to see on the page.

When you finish all the editing you want to make on the Home menu option. You 
must save the change for it to be updated on your Home. If you do not save the 
changes, the old texts will still appear on the website. 
To save the changes you made, look at the bottom right part of the page that 
opened. That is where you see the change take place as you type in your words. 
You will see a green design titled "Update". Click on the Update and your changes 
will be saved. 

Fig 6.5: The editing of Home using “Edit with Elementor approach” 
![ Fig 6.5: The editing of Home using “Edit with Elementor approach” ](fig_6.5_the_editing_of.webp)

Even if in the future you still want to make some changes on your home, still use 
this approach so far you are making use of Astra theme. I said you should first visit 
your website while you already login to your WordPress in a tab. Click on the 
Home menu item. This is followed by clicking on "Edit with Elementor". And 
finally, you make changes on the areas you want and click on Update. When you 
visit your Home through any browser whether you login to your WordPress or not, 
you see these changes. 
Note: Make sure you carry out this task using your computer or laptops. Task of 
this kind may not be completed in most android phones.

### Adding New Menu Item from Scratch 

I know I touched this area in this chapter as I explained menu items. But I decided 
to explain it in a separate subheading for in-depth understanding. Adding of menu 
items is one of the areas new website builders find difficult to complete. 
As a result of that, I decided to make it a separate area of interest. When I started 
building website newly, I usually run into trouble when I wanted to add menu 
items. Sometimes I began to feel headache while trying to do this. But today, it is a
history as I have over 6 years of experience in website design and building. 
Practical on Adding New Menu Item from Scratch 
Do not forget that we are still using Astra theme as our theme in this teaching. So, 
we are to create and design the page using Elementor before we add the page as a 
menu item. In this teaching, I will be creating a menu item called Our Books. So 
calmly observe how I will do this from Scratch. 
The quick procedures in adding menu item from scratch using any Astra theme is 
as follow: 

- Login to your WordPress dashboard 

Fig 6.7: Already logged in to WordPress 
![ Fig 6.7: Already logged in to WordPress ](fig_6.7_already_logged_in.webp)

- Selected Pages 

Fig 6.8: Selecting Page 
![ Fig 6.8: Selecting Page ](fig_6.8_selecting_page.webp)

- Click on Add New 
- Add your new title 

Fig 6.9: Adding new page title
![ Fig 6.9: Adding new page title ](fig_6.9_adding_new_page.webp)

- Click on Edith with Elementor at the top of the title 

Fig 6.1.1; Arrow pointing at Edit with Elementor 
![ Fig 6.1.1; Arrow pointing at Edit with Elementor ](fig_6.1.1_arrow_pointing_at.webp)

- Drag and drop "Heading" module in the space provided at the right-hand side 

Fig 6.1.2: Drag and drop the heading module with symbol T into the space the arrow points to. 
![ Fig 6.1.2: Drag and drop the heading module with symbol T into the space the arrow points to. ](fig_6.1.2_drag_and_drop.webp)

- Click on the Starter Template with symbol A to choose a single page template to 
design the page

Fig 6.1.3: Arrow shows the Astra Starter symbol you are to select to choose any template/theme of your choice 
![ Fig 6.1.3: Arrow shows the Astra Starter symbol you are to select to choose any template/theme of your choice ](fig_6.1.3_arrow_shows_the.webp)

- Select from the templates. You can decide to choose the same design/template 
with the one your homepage and other pages are using 

Fig 6.1.4: Selection from lists of templates/themes that showed up 
![ Fig 6.1.4: Selection from lists of templates/themes that showed up ](fig_6.1.4_selection_from_lists.webp)

Because I want the background to be the same with the one in my other menu 
items, I decided to choose the theme called Mountain which is what other of my 
pages/menu items are using. But if you want a different background in that page 
which will form a menu item later, you can decide to choose any other. 

- Select from the makeup designs that follow the selected theme

Fig 6.1.5: Selecting from the makeup designs that follows the theme 
![ Fig 6.1.5: Selecting from the makeup designs that follows the theme ](fig_6.1.5_selecting_from_the.webp)

Sometimes some themes come with other makeup designs of the same theme. 
When I selected Mountain theme, I was showed sub designs of the same theme. 
Because I want everything to be the same with the one that other pages on my web- 
site have, I then chose the first by my right to build my page which I named “Our 
Books”. Do not forget the reason we are building this page is to be able to use it to 
form a menu item at the end. So do not lose focus. We are going somewhere. 

- Import the template into the page 

Fig 6.1.6: Importing the selected template into the page 
![ Fig 6.1.6: Importing the selected template into the page ](fig_6.1.6_importing_the_selected.webp)

Do not be confused because you are seeing “About” as the heading of the page. 
That is because the template was designed originally like that. After import, we will 
edit that heading and change it to “Our Books”. We will also change the other con- 
tents of the page. 

- Start editing the texts on the theme You can also delete the picture in the theme 
and replace them with your own pictures which you can upload from your com- 
puter.

Fig 6.1.7: Before the editing of the text and changing of images 
![ Fig 6.1.7: Before the editing of the text and changing of images ](fig_6.1.7_before_the_editing.webp)

- Once you are done with editing, then update the page. You can do that by clicking 
on the update button at the bottom. 

Fig 6.1.8: Arrow pointing at where to click to update your page after editing 
![ Fig 6.1.8: Arrow pointing at where to click to update your page after editing ](fig_6.1.8_arrow_pointing_at.webp)

After you have done all the steps, the next is to add this created and designed page 
as a menu item or menu bar as some people call it. 
If you want to create many menu items, still do it the way I explained here. When 
you finish creating the first page, go back to the dashboard, and follow the same 
guide and create other pages that will form your menu contents. It is as simple as 
explained. If in the future you want to remove any of the menu items, just go to the 
page that forms the menu items and delete it or even through menu items listing in 
the dashboard. 
 
### Adding the Page to form a menu Item 

In the previous heading, we discussed how to create a page which we will use to 
form our menu item. By menu item, I mean the contents of a particular navigation 
menu. 
As shown in the caption from bbc.com website on June 5, 2020, News, Sport, Reel, 
Worklife, Travel, Future, Culture, Music and More are all menu items. My teaching 
is on how that kind of designs were created.

![ Fig 6.1.9: Menu items of bbc.com ](fig_6.1.9_menu_items_of_bbc.webp)

### Steps in Adding the Created Page as a Menu Item 

Since we have created a page already called "Our Books", the steps in adding it as a
menu item is simple. Know that the use of the words “select” and “click” in this 
teaching imply almost the same thing. Do the following to add it as a menu item: 

- Login to your WordPress dashboard 
- Click on Appearance 

Fig 6.2.1: Appearance selected as one of the steps to add menu item to websites 
![ Fig 6.2.1: Appearance selected as one of the steps to add menu item to websites ](fig_6.2.1_appearance_selected_as.webp)

- Select customize 

Fig 6.2.2: Arrow points at Customize sub screen option 
![ Fig 6.2.2: Arrow points at Customize sub screen option ](fig_6.2.2_arrow_points_at.webp)

- Select Menus 

Fig 6.2.3: Arrow pointing at Menus option 
![ Fig 6.2.3: Arrow pointing at Menus option ](fig_6.2.3_arrow_pointing_at.webp)

This arrangement may vary depending on the theme you are using. But just look at 
the Menus or Menu in the arrangement. 

- Select Navigation (currently set to: Primary menu) 

Fig 6.2.4: Arrow points at the current Menu in use 
![ Fig 6.2.4: Arrow points at the current Menu in use ](fig_6.2.4_arrow_points_at.webp)

There can be many menus existing on a website. Each of these menus is made up 
of menu items. So, you are to choose the menu that is currently in use. In the 
screenshot, the current menu in use is the menu named Navigation. 

- Click on Add Items 

Fig 6.2.5: Arrow points at Add Items 
![ Fig 6.2.5: Arrow points at Add Items ](fig_6.2.5_arrow_points_at.webp)

It is important to know that category, posts and even tags can be used as me but 
items. But here, we base our teaching on using pages as menu items. And the 
menu item we want to add is named Our Books. 

- Click on the page you want to add

Fig 6.2.6: Arrow points at the page to be added 
![ Fig 6.2.6: Arrow points at the page to be added ](fig_6.2.6_arrow_points_at.webp)

- Arrange it in order as it is added to menu Items if you do not like the arrangement 
- Hit Publish 

Fig 6.2.7: Arrow points at publish button 
![ Fig 6.2.7: Arrow points at publish button ](fig_6.2.7_arrow_points_at.webp)

Once this is done, that page is published as a menu item. If you visit your website, 
you will see the change. Example when I visit my teaching website teachkin- 
dle.com, I will see “Our Books” as one of the menu bars items. If I click on it, it will 
open to a new page showing the contents of the page. 
If you did not click on publish after you passed through all the stress of putting any 
page or pages as a menu item, you will not see that page appear in the menu bar 
when you visit your website. Because this is important, ensure you click on publish 
before you leave the platform after creating menu bar item or items.

# Chapter 7 How to Insert Logo, Site Title and Setup Search Box on a Website 

 
There are thousands of websites that make use of logo. Some have unique logo 
that once you see them, you do not need to keep asking yourself of the URL of the 
website because you have already known that. It is the identity of such websites. 
An example of such websites are WordPress, Wikipedia, and BBC. These are pop- 
ular websites known globally. Once you see their logos, you already know them. 
In the same line, if your website logo is known by your readers, it would not take 
them time to know anytime they see some articles appear in search engines which 
point to your website. It is a unique identity that some websites are known with. 
Website logos design are usually contracted to graphic designers who design them 
to the taste of website builders. These website builders later upload and insert 
them into websites. But some website builders who have graphic design skills 
sometimes design and upload to different websites they work on. 
Some builders do not use logo on websites. Sometimes they replace the logo with 
texts. These texts are just the name of the website. On the learning website am 
using to teach you, www.teachkindle.com, I can decide not to use logo but just the 
site name. We will be discussing how to do this in detail in future subheadings of 
this chapter. 
Search box is an important tool used in websites today. It helps visitors to search 
for a particular title of their choice on a website. Maybe they read a particular topic 
on your website before but wants to read that again after months when they have 
forgotten the complete title of the post. When they type in the keywords that make 
the title in a search box of your website, that title can show up. 
Modern search box implementations make use of persistent connections to 
achieve both low-latency search experience and bandwidth improvement. However,
achieve both low-latency search experience and bandwidth improvement. However, 
for large, search-intensive web applications, a scalable server being able to handle 
a high number of concurrent persistent connections is needed. Such servers al- 
ready exist. 
 
## How to Add Search on your Website 

Whether search box or search, we are talking about the same thing. Search box as 
we said helps site readers to find posts and pages easily. In this section, I will be 
teaching you how you can add Search to the header section of your website using 
WordPress Content Management System. 
The steps to add Search to your website is as follow: 

- Login to your dashboard 

When you login, you will see many screen options showed to you. You are to 
choose the option that will get us what we want to achieve. 

- Select Appearance 

Fig 7: Arrow points at appearance which you are to select. 
![ Fig 7: Arrow points at appearance which you are to select ](fig_7_arrow_points_at.webp)

- Select Widgets 

Fig 7.1: Arrow shows Widgets to select 
![ Fig 7.1: Arrow shows Widgets to select ](fig_7.1_arrow_shows_widgets.webp)

When Widgets screen sub option is clicked on, a new page is opened by the sys- 
tem. 

- Check in the list of options and select Search

Fig 7.2: Arrow points at the Search Widget 
![ Fig 7.2: Arrow points at the Search Widget ](fig_7.2_arrow_points_at.webp)

There are many widgets that will show up when you click on the Widgets at the 
screen. Just search for the one named Search and click on it. The position of a wid- 
get can vary depending on the theme installed. But look for the Search Box or 
Search widget and select it. 

- Select Header, and then Add Widget 

The reason for selecting Header is because I want the Search to be at the header 
part of my website. 

Fig 7.3: Arrow points at where I want to place the Search on my website and Add Widget 
![ Fig 7.3: Arrow points at where I want to place the Search on my website and Add Widget ](fig_7.3_arrow_points_at.webp)

There are many parts of the website you can add the widget to. It can be added to 
Footer area, side bar or header of any website. But the best place to have it is on 
the header. This will make it noticeable by the readers of the website content. 
Because of this, I selected Header as where to place the Search widget. Also make 
sure you click on Add Widget after the selection. 

- Click on Done

Fig 7.4: Arrow points at where to click to save your changes. 
![ Fig 7.4: Arrow points at where to click to save your changes ](fig_7.4_arrow_points_at.webp)

Once you click on done, everything is in order. The changes you made has been 
saved. You can even decide to give the Search a title. You can type in “Search 
through this Website” as title or Search Bar or anything that interests you. 
After this, you can check through your website to see the Search show on your 
website. 

Fig 7.5: Arrow shows the newly integrated Search on the website. 
![ Fig 7.5: Arrow shows the newly integrated Search on the website ](fig_7.5_arrow_shows_the.webp)

Note: If you do not like the way the Search you have in your widget appears on your 
website, you can get a new one with different design. Go to your dashboard, in the 
Plugins section, click on Add new and type “Search” in the box provided for you. 
You will be shown some search plugins. You make your choice and choose any. Install and activate it. Then choose the section of the website you want it to be. If this 
option does not work well, you can search through search engine for any HTML 
code to insert on the header section of your website to generate nice search box for 
your site. There are many codes out there to help you. 
 
## How to Place Logo on your Website 

A logo is a small graphic sign that identifies a company, association, organization, 
brand, team, product, website or person. Here we are going to be discussing how 
you can upload your already designed logo which will identify your website to your 
readers. 
Logo design is the work of graphic designers. But is an advantage to you if you 
have the skill. Just know the dimension required by your website and get the logo 
done. 
The steps to upload a logo to your website to make it visible to visitors to your 
website are as follow: 

- Login to your WordPress admin dashboard 
- Select Appearance screen option 
- Locate Customize screen option and click on it

Fig 7.6: Arrow points at Customize screen option under Appearance 
![ Fig 7.6: Arrow points at Customize screen option under Appearance ](fig_7.6_arrow_points_at.webp)

Even if you made a mistake and clicked on another option in your attempt to click 
on Customize, just go back and click on the right one which is Customize. 

- Select Header 

Fig 7.7: Arrow points at the Header 
![ Fig 7.7: Arrow points at the Header ](fig_7.7_arrow_points_at.webp)

It is important you know that the position of “Header” when Customize is selected 
can vary depending on the theme you are using. If you are using any theme dif- 
ferent from Astra to build your own website using WordPress, just look for the 
position of your own Header and click on it. 

- Select Site Identity

Fig 7.8: Arrow shows Site Identity 
![ Fig 7.8: Arrow shows Site Identity ](fig_7.8_arrow_shows_site.webp)

- Click on Select Logo under Logo heading 

Fig 7.9: Arrow points at select Logo which you are to select 
![ Fig 7.9: Arrow points at select Logo which you are to select ](fig_7.9_points_at_select.webp)

When you click on that tab, it opens a window which leaves you with opportunities 
to select your site logo from already existing pictures in your WordPress gallery, 
online picture publishing websites, or from the pictures in your computer. So, you 
know where your logo is saved, and you are to pick it from where it was saved. 

- Choose logo design of your choice

Fig 7.1.1: Selecting a logo in progress 
![ Fig 7.1.1: Selecting a logo in progress ](fig_7.1.1_selecting_a_logo.webp)

From the screenshot, I was given three options on where to pick my logo from. I 
chose the option of “Upload Files”. I uploaded the Logo I wanted to use from my 
laptop computer. 
 
- Click on Select

Fig 7.1.2: Picture shows the position of Select 
![ Fig 7.1.2: Picture shows the position of Select ](fig_7.1.2_picture_shows_the.webp)

- Crop the logo or skip cropping 

Fig 7.1.3: Cropping of my Logo 
![ Fig 7.1.3: Cropping of my Logo ](fig_7.1.3_cropping_of_my.webp)

You can decide to crop the logo or upload it like that. It can be auto fitted even if
you choose not to crop it. You are to click on “Skip Cropping” if you do not want to 
crop or hit “Crop Image” when you are done cropping. 

- Click publish

## How to Insert or Change a Website Title and Description

It is usually difficult for beginners in website building to know how to change their 
website name. Also, some still find it difficult to change the site description. In this 
subheading, I will be walking you through on how to get this task done. It is a sim- 
ple task to carry out in as much as you know what to do and how to do them. 
Some people have built a blog site with their initial idea of writing on a niche. But 
along the line the story changed. As the story changed, they expanded the cate- 
gories they were writing on. As this happened, they needed to change the title and 
descriptions of their websites. 
Maybe the author was initially focusing on only news niche and as time went on 
decided to integrate education articles into the niche. As this happened, the web- 
site builder needs to change the title and the description of the website. If the initial 
description was "All About News Update" the site builder can change the descrip- 
tion to something like "Great News Zone and Education Materials. In the later de- 
scription, it encompasses the newly added niche to the website. 
If you are building any website that you want to teach people something new in dif- 
ferent genre, it may require you changing the titles and the description of the web- 
site very often. So, there are reasons why people may like to change the title and 
description of their websites as time goes on. No matter what the reason may be, 
may job to you is to teach you how you can do that as fast and as neat as possible. 
 
### Practical: How to Change your Website Title and Description 

We will be practicing this using our learning website www.teachkindle.com. We will 
be taking a look at how the site looks right now and after the redesign will see the 
change in the look of the website. 

Fig 7.1.6: www.teachkindle.com before changing of its title and description 
a![ Fig 7.1.6: www.teachkindle.com before changing of its title and description ](fig_7.1.6-before_changing_of.webp)

The steps on how to change your website title and description through WordPress 
admin dashboard are as follow: 

- Login to your admin dashboard 
- Select Appearance 
- Select Customize 

Fig 7.1.7: The position of Customize pointed by the arrow symbol 
![ Fig 7.1.7: The position of Customize pointed by the arrow symbol ](fig_7.1.7-the_position_of.webp)

- Choose Header 
- Choose Site Identity 

Fig 7.1.8a: Arrow points at the Site Identity position 
![ Fig 7.1.8a: Arrow points at the Site Identity position ](fig_7.1.8a-points_at_the.webp)

- Make the changes needed under Site Title and Tagline 

Fig 7.1.8b: Arrow points at the positions to make changes 
![ Fig 7.1.8b: Arrow points at the positions to make changes ](fig_7.1.8b-at_the_positions.webp)

Since we want to change the website title and description, just click inside the pro- 
vided space, erase the words that were there before and type something new which 
you want as title and site description. 
 
- Check/tick the box "Display Site Title" and "Display Tagline"

Fig 7.1.9: Arrow points at the direction of the already checked or ticked boxes 
![ Fig 7.1.9: Arrow points at the direction of the already checked or ticked boxes ](fig_7.1.9-the_direction_of.webp)

These terms may vary depending on the theme in use. For example, some themes 
can have "Site Name" in place of "Site Title" and "Site Description" in place of 
"Tag Line". So, use your head and know what to do when you get there. 
 
- Click on Publish on top right corner.
