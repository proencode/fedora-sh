Section 1: Classical Patterns
In this section, we will cover the basic syntax of the Kotlin programming language and the implementation of all the classical design patterns in Kotlin.

The classical design patterns deal with three major problems in system design: how to create objects efficiently, how to encapsulate object hierarchies, and how to make object behavior more dynamic.

We'll discuss which design patterns come as part of the language, and how to implement those that don't.

This section comprises the following chapters:

Chapter 1, Getting Started with Kotlin
Chapter 2, Working with Creational Patterns
Chapter 3, Understanding Structural Patterns
