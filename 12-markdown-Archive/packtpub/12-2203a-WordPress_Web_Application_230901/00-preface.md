# Preface

As it approaches the twentieth anniversary of its initial release, WordPress continues to be one of the most widely used, powerful, and open **content management systems (CMSs)**. Whether you're a site owner trying to find the right extension, a developer who wants to contribute to the community, or a website developer working to fulfill a client's needs, learning how to extend WordPress' capabilities will help you to unleash its full potential.

This book will help you become familiar with API functions to create secure plugins with easy-to-use administration interfaces. Complete with new recipes and up-to-date code samples, including new chapters on the creation of custom blocks for the Block Editor and interacting with external data sources, this third-edition WordPress plugin development book teaches you how to create plugins of varying complexity ranging from using just a few lines of code to complex extensions that provide intricate new capabilities.

Starting with WordPress' basic mechanism for creating plugins, the book covers recipes to show you how to design administration panels, enhance the post editor with custom fields, store custom data, and even create custom blocks. You'll safely incorporate dynamic elements into web pages using scripting languages, learn how to integrate data from external sources, and build new widgets that can be added to WordPress sidebars and widget areas. By the end of this book, you'll be able to create WordPress plugins to perform almost any task you can imagine.

# Who this book is for

This book is for WordPress users, developers, and site integrators interested in creating new plugins to address their personal needs, fulfill client requirements, and bring new capabilities to the WordPress community. Basic knowledge of PHP and WordPress is expected.

What this book covers
Chapter 1, Preparing a Local Development Environment, shows plugin developers how to install and configure an efficient development environment.

Chapter 2, Plugin Framework Basics, explains the basic mechanics of registering user functions with WordPress to be executed at key points when web pages are displayed, forming the basis of plugin creation.

Chapter 3, User Settings and Administration Pages, covers the creation of administration pages that will allow users to configure the plugins you create.

Chapter 4, The Power of Custom Post Types, empowers developers to add whole new content management sections to the WordPress environment.

Chapter 5, Customizing Post and Page Editors, demonstrates how to alter the default administration post and page editing environment to add new capabilities.

Chapter 6, Extending the Block Editor, shows how to create new content blocks for the new Block Editor and facilitate building websites.

Chapter 7, Accepting User Content Submissions, allows users to submit their own content to new content sections that will be managed by your plugins.

Chapter 8, Customizing User Data, explains how to store additional information for users and how to modify site output based on this data.

Chapter 9, Leveraging JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX Scripts, makes plugin output very dynamic by using a number of popular script libraries.

Chapter 10, Adding New Widgets to the WordPress Library, shows how to add new widgets that users will be able to easily drag and drop to add content to their web pages.

Chapter 11, Fetching, Caching, and Regularly Updating External Site Data, explains how to extract data from external sites and locally cache that data for efficient use.

Chapter 12, Enabling Plugin Internationalization, prepares your plugin to be translated into any language to make it easier to be used by non-English speakers.

Chapter 13, Distributing Your Plugin on WordPress.org, shows you how to prepare your plugin for sharing with the global WordPress community.

To get the most out of this book
All code examples in this book have been tested against WordPress 5.9 using the Twenty Twenty-Two theme, unless otherwise noted. As WordPress always strives for backward compatibility, they will likely work with future versions as well. All other software tools needed are covered in Chapter 1, Preparing a Local Development Environment.
