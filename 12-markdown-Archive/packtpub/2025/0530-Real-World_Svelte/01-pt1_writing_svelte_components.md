# 01 Part 1: Writing Svelte Components

In this section, we will lay the foundation for writing Svelte components. We will kick things off by delving into the lifecycles of Svelte components. Then, we will learn how to style and theme our Svelte components. After that, we will explore the intricacies of data passing between components and finally wrap up with techniques to compose components into a cohesive Svelte application.

This part has the following chapters:

- Chapter 1, Lifecycles in Svelte
- Chapter 2, Implementing Styling and Theming
- Chapter 3, Managing Props and State
- Chapter 4, Composing Components
