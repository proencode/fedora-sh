# 00 Preface

In today‚Äôs digital age, web development is ever-evolving, with new tools and frameworks emerging almost daily. Among them, Svelte stands out, being voted in the top place as the most beloved framework in a recent developer survey (https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-and-technologies). Svelte brings a fresh perspective by optimizing performance and providing an intuitive design, as well as being fully featured.

While other resources out there cover Svelte‚Äôs vast features, this book offers a unique lens and approach. We‚Äôll delve deep into key Svelte features, demystifying core concepts. Through hands-on, real-world examples, we‚Äôll not only teach the ‚Äúhow‚Äù but also the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each approach. By understanding the underlying principles and thought processes, you‚Äôll be equipped to seamlessly integrate what you learn into your Svelte projects.

# Who this book is for

This book is tailored for web developers and software engineers who possess a foundational understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and general web development practices. Whether you're new to Svelte and are eager to dive deep or have dabbled with its basics but seek to elevate your expertise through real-world examples and patterns, this guide is for you. Beyond mere instruction, the content delves into the 'why' and 'how' behind each concept, ensuring readers not only grasp the material but can also effectively apply it in professional contexts and diverse projects. If you're ready to not just learn about Svelte but to master its intricacies and practical applications, then this book is your next essential read.

# What this book covers

*`Chapter 1`*, **Lifecycles in Svelte**, provides an overview of Svelte‚Äôs lifecycles, their respective functions, the rules for invoking them, and strategies to reuse and compose these lifecycle functions.

*`Chapter 2`*, **Implementing Styling and Theming**, dives into six unique methods to style Svelte components. You will also learn the essentials of theming Svelte components*, from defining themes to enabling user customization.

*`Chapter 3`*, **Managing Props and State**, deepens your understanding of props and state within Svelte. This chapter demystifies props, state, and bindings, and discusses the distinctions between one-way and two-way data bindings. It also showcases deriving state from props.

*`Chapter 4`*, **Composing Components**, provides techniques to control content within child components from their parent components. You will explore the `<slot>` element and various Svelte special elements, such as `<svelte:self>` and `<svelte:fragment>`.

*`Chapter 5`*, **Custom Events with Actions**, kickstarts your exploration of Svelte actions over three chapters. This chapter starts by exploring the idea of creating custom events using Svelte actions.

*`Chapter 6`*, **Integrating Libraries with Actions**, provides a hands-on guide to integrating a third-party JavaScript library into Svelte using actions.

*`Chapter 7`*, **Progressive Enhancements with Svelte Actions**, unpacks the concept of progressive enhancements and helps you understand how Svelte actions can be leveraged to progressively enhance your Svelte application.

*`Chapter 8`*, **Context versus Stores**, delves into Svelte context and stores. You‚Äôll learn how and when to use Svelte context and stores.

*`Chapter 9`*, **Implementing Custom Stores**, teaches you how to implement custom Svelte stores through a practical step-by-step guide, going through multiple real-world examples along the way.

*`Chapter 10`*, **State Management with Svelte Stores**, arms you with practical tips on managing application state in Svelte applications. You will also learn how to use third-party state management libraries in Svelte.

*`Chapter 11`*, **Renderless Components**, explores the concept of the renderless component, a type of reusable component that does not render any HTML elements of its own. We will systematically go through implementing such a component.

*`Chapter 12`*, **Stores and Animations**, explores the built-in `tweened` and `spring` stores. You‚Äôll learn how to apply them in your Svelte application, and how to customize the interpolation for these animating stores.

*`Chapter 13`*, **Using Transitions**, provides a comprehensive understanding of transitions in Svelte. You‚Äôll learn how to use transitions in Svelte, when and how transitions are played, and how they work under the hood.

*`Chapter 14`*, **Exploring Custom Transitions**, explores the idea of writing a custom transition in Svelte. You‚Äôll learn about the Svelte transition contract, and with practical examples, you‚Äôll be guided step by step through creating a custom transition in Svelte.

*`Chapter 15`*, **Accessibility with Transitions**, sheds light on accessibility considerations in transitions, particularly for users with vestibular disorders. You‚Äôll gain insights into crafting responsible transitions that respect user preferences and cater to all.

# Conventions used

There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.

`Code in text`: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: ‚ÄúMount the downloaded `WebStorm-10*.dmg` disk image file as another disk in your system.‚Äù

A block of code is set as follows:

```
const folder = [
  { type: 'file', name: 'a.js' },
  { type: 'file', name: 'b.js' },
  { type: 'folder', name: 'c', children: [
    { type: 'file', name: 'd.js' },
  ]},
];
```

When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:

```
<!-- filename: JsonTree.svelte -->
<script>
  export let data;
</script>
<ul>
  {#each Object.entries(data) as [key, value]}
    <li>
      {key}:
      {#if typeof value === 'object'}
        <svelte:self data={value} />
      {:else}
        {value}
      {/if}
    <li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

`Bold`: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in bold. Here is an example: ‚ÄúWhen you have a `<form>` element, by default when you hit the Submit button, it will navigate to the location indicated by the `action` attribute, carrying along with it the value filled in the `<input>` elements within the `<form>` element.‚Äù
