# 00 Preface

Django is an open-source Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development and presents a relatively shallow learning curve for beginner programmers. Django follows Python‚Äôs ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù philosophy, shipping with a rich and versatile set of modules that solve common web-development problems. The simplicity of Django, together with its powerful features, makes it attractive to both novice and expert programmers. Django has been designed for simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and scalability.

Nowadays, Django is used by countless start-ups and large organizations such as Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest, Udemy, Robinhood, and Coursera. It is not by coincidence that, over the last few years, Django has consistently been chosen by developers worldwide as one of the most loved web frameworks in Stack Overflow‚Äôs annual developer survey.

This book will guide you through the entire process of developing professional web applications with Django. The book focuses on explaining how the Django web framework works by building multiple projects from the ground up. This book not only covers the most relevant aspects of the framework but also explains how to apply Django to very diverse real-world situations.

This book not only teaches Django but also presents other popular technologies, such as PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, and Memcached. You will learn how to integrate these technologies into your Django projects throughout the book to create advanced functionalities and build complex web applications.

Django 5 By Example will walk you through the creation of real-world applications, solving commonproblems, and implementing best practices, using a step-by-step approach that is easy to follow.

After reading this book, you will have a good understanding of how Django works and how to build full-fledged Python web applications.

# Who this book is for

This book should serve as a primer for programmers newly initiated to Django. The book is intended for developers with Python knowledge who wish to learn Django in a pragmatic manner. Perhaps you are completely new to Django, or you already know a little but you want to get the most out of it. This book will help you to master the most relevant areas of the framework by building practical projects from scratch. You need to have familiarity with programming concepts in order to read this book. In addition to basic Python knowledge, some previous knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is assumed.

# What this book covers

This book encompasses a range of topics of web application development with Django. The book will guide you through building four different fully-featured web applications, that are built over the course of 17 chapters.

- A blog application (chapters 1 to 3)
- An image bookmarking website (chapters 4 to 7)
- An online shop (chapters 8 to 11)
- An e-learning platform (chapters 12 to 17)

Each chapter covers several Django features.

Chapter 1, Building a Blog Application, will introduce you to the framework through a blog application. You will create the basic blog models, views, templates, and URLs to display blog posts. You will learn how to build QuerySets with the Django **object-relational mapper (ORM)**, and you will configure the Django administration site.

Chapter 2, Enhancing Your Blog with Advanced Features, will teach you how to add pagination to your blog, and how to implement Django class-based views. You will learn to send emails with Django, and handle forms and model forms. You will also implement a comment system for blog posts.

Chapter 3, Extending Your Blog Application, explores how to integrate third-party applications. This chapter will guide you through the process of creating a tagging system, and you will learn how to build complex QuerySets to recommed similar posts. The chapter will teach you how to create custom template tags and filters. You will also learn how to use the sitemap framework and create an RSS feed for your posts. You will complete your blog application by building a search engine using PostgreSQL‚Äôs full-text search capabilities.

Chapter 4, Building a Social Website, explains how to build a social website. You will learn how to implement user authentication views and learn to use the Django authentication framework. You will implement user registration and extend the user model with a custom profile model.

Chapter 5, Implementing Social Authentication, covers implementing social authentication and using the messages framework. You will create a custom authentication backend and you will integrate social authentication with Google, using OAuth 2. You will learn how to use `django-extensions` to run the development server through HTTPS and customize the social authentication pipeline to automate the user profile creation.

Chapter 6, Sharing Content on Your Website, will teach you how to transform your social application into an image bookmarking website. You will define many-to-many relationships for models, and you will create a JavaScript bookmarklet that integrates into your project. The chapter will show you how to generate image thumbnails. You will also learn how to implement asynchronous HTTP requests using JavaScript and Django and you will implement infinite scroll pagination.

Chapter 7, Tracking User Actions, will show you how to build a follower system for users. You will complete your image bookmarking website by creating a user activity stream application. You will learn how to create generic relations between models and optimize QuerySets.

You will work with signals and implement denormalization. You will use Django Debug Toolbar to obtain relevant debug information. Finally, you will integrate Redis into your project to count image views and you will create a ranking of the most viewed images with Redis.

Chapter 8, Building an Online Shop, explores how to create an online shop. You will build models for a product catalog, and you will create a shopping cart using Django sessions. You will build a context processor for the shopping cart and will learn how to manage customer orders. The chapter will teach you how to send asynchronous notifications using Celery and RabbitMQ. You will also learn to monitor Celery using Flower.
