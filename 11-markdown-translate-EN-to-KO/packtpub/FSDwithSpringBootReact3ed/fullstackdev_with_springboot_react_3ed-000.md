# Preface

Getting started with full stack development can be daunting. Even developers who are familiar with the best tools, such as Spring Boot and React, can struggle to nail the basics, let alone master the more advanced elements. If you're one of these developers, this comprehensive guide covers everything you need!

This updated edition of the Full Stack Development with Spring Boot and React book will take you from novice to proficient in this expansive domain. Taking a practical approach, this book will first walk you through the latest Spring Boot features for creating a robust backend, covering everything from setting up the environment and dependency injection to security and testing.

Once this has been covered, you'll advance to React frontend programming. If you've ever wondered about custom Hooks, third-party components, and MUI, this book will demystify all that and much more. You'll explore everything that goes into developing, testing, securing, and deploying your applications using all the latest tools from Spring Boot, React, and other cutting-edge technologies.

By the end of this book, you'll not only have learned the theory of building modern full stack applications but also have developed valuable skills that add value in any setting.

# Who this book is for

This book is for Java developers who are familiar with Spring Boot but don't know where to start when it comes to building full stack applications. You'll also find this book useful if you're a frontend developer with knowledge of JavaScript basics, looking to learn full stack development, or a full stack developer experienced in other technology stacks, looking to learn a new one.

# To get the most out of this book

You will need Spring Boot version 2.x in this book. There are some major changes in the upcoming Spring Boot version 3 that are mentioned in the book. All code examples are tested using Spring Boot 2.6 and React 18 on Windows. When installing any React libraries, you should check the latest installation command from their documentation and see whether there are any major changes related to the version used in this book.

If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book's GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.
