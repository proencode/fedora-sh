# Chapter 3: Using JPA to Create and Access a Database

This chapter covers how to use **Java Persistent API (JPA)** with Spring Boot and how to define a database by using entity classes. In the first phase, we will be using the H2 in-memory database for development and demonstration purposes. H2 is an in-memory SQL database that is good for fast development or demonstration purposes. In the second phase, we will move from H2 to use **MariaDB**. This chapter also describes the creation of CRUD repositories and a one-to-many connection between database tables.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

- Basics of ORM, JPA, and Hibernate
- Creating the entity classes
- Creating CRUD repositories
- Adding relationships between tables
- Setting up the MariaDB database

# Technical requirements

Java SDK version 8 or higher is necessary to use Spring Boot (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). The Spring Boot application we created in previous chapters is required.

A MariaDB installation is necessary to create the database application (https://downloads.mariadb.org/).

The code for this chapter can be found at the following GitHub link: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Development-with-Spring-Boot-and-React/tree/main/Chapter03.

Check out the following video to see the Code in Action: https://bit.ly/3lVCuVe

# Basics of ORM, JPA, and Hibernate

**Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a technique that allows you to fetch from and manipulate a database by using an object-oriented programming paradigm. ORM is really good for programmers because it relies on object-oriented concepts rather than database structures. It also makes development much faster and reduces the amount of source code. ORM is mostly independent of databases, and developers don't have to worry about vendor-specific SQL statements.

**Java Persistent API (JPA)** provides object-relational mapping for Java developers. The JPA entity is a Java class that presents the structure of a database table. The fields of an entity class present the columns of the database tables.

**Hibernate** is the most popular Java-based JPA implementation and is used in Spring Boot by default. Hibernate is a mature product and is widely used in large-scale applications.

Next, we will start to implement our first entity class using the H2 database.

# Creating the entity classes

An entity class is a simple Java class that is annotated with JPA's `@Entity` annotation. Entity classes use the standard JavaBean naming convention and have proper getter and setter methods. The class fields have private visibility.

JPA creates a database table called by the name of the class when the application is initialized. If you want to use some other name for the database table, you can use the `@Table` annotation in your entity class.

At the beginning of this chapter, we will use the H2 database (https://www.h2database.com/), which is embedded in our in-memory database. To be able to use JPA and the H2 database, we have to add the following dependencies to the `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

Let's look at the following steps to create entity classes:

1. To create an entity class in Spring Boot, we must create a package for entities. The package should be created under the root package. To start this, activate the root package in Eclipse's Project Explorer and right-click to make a context menu appear.
2. From this menu, select New | Package. The following screenshot shows how to create a package for entity classes:

![ 103-01 New package ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-01_new_package.jpg)

3. We will name our package `com.packt.cardatabase.domain`:

![ 103-02 New Java Package ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-02_new_java_package.jpg)

4. Next, we will create our entity class. Activate a new `com.packt.cardatabase.domain` package, right-click it, and select **New | Class** from the menu.
5. Because we are going to create a car database, the name of the entity class will be `Car`. Type `Car` in the **Name** field and then press the **Finish** button, as shown in the following screenshot:

![ 103-03 New Java Class ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-03_new_java_class.jpg)

6. Open the `Car` class file in the editor by double-clicking it in the project explorer. First, we must annotate the class with the `@Entity` annotation. The `@Entity` annotation is imported from the `javax.persistence` package:
```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
@Entity
public class Car {
}
```

> 
> You can use the Ctrl + Shift + O shortcut in Eclipse IDE to import missing packages automatically.
{.is-success}

> Important Note
> 
> This book is based on Spring Boot 2 and the upcoming Spring Boot 3 is using Jakarta EE instead of Java EE. Therefore, you need to replace all javax imports with jakarta if you are using Spring Boot 3.
> 
> For example, javax.persistence.Entity is replaced with jakarta.persistence.Entity
{.is-info}

7. Next, we must add some fields to our class. The entity class fields are mapped to database table columns. The entity class must also contain a unique ID that is used as a primary key in the database:
```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
@Entity
public class Car {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private long id;
    private String brand, model, color, 
             registerNumber;
    private int year, price;
}
```

> Tip
> 
> You can use the Ctrl + Shift + O shortcut in the Eclipse IDE to import missing packages automatically.
{.is-success}

The primary key is defined by using the `@Id` annotation. The `@GeneratedValue` annotation defines that the ID is automatically generated by the database. We can also define our key generation strategy; the `AUTO` type means that the JPA provider selects the best strategy for a particular database and that it is also the default generation type. As well as this, you can create a composite primary key by annotating multiple attributes with the `@Id` annotation.

The database columns are named according to class field naming conventions by default. If you want to use some other naming convention, you can use the `@Column` annotation. With the `@Column` annotation, you can define the column's length and whether the column is `nullable`. The following code shows an example of using the `@Column` annotation. With this definition, the column's name in the database is `explanation`, the length of the column is `512`, and it is not `nullable`:

```
@Column(name="explanation", nullable=false, length=512)
private String description
```

8. Finally, we must add getters, setters, and constructors with attributes to the entity class. We don't need an ID field in our constructor due to automatic ID generation. The source code of the `Car` entity class constructors is as follows:
> Tip
> 
> Eclipse provides the automatic addition of getters, setters, and constructors. Activate your cursor inside the class and right-click. From the menu, select **Source | Generate Getters and Setters...** or **Source | Generate Constructor using fields....**
{.is-success}

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
@Entity
public class Car {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private long id;
    private String brand, model, color, 
        registerNumber;
    private int year, price;
    
    public Car() {}
    
    public Car(String brand, String model, String 
        color, 
             String registerNumber, int year, int 
                 price) {
        super();
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.registerNumber = registerNumber;
        this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
    }
```

The following is the source code for the `Car` entity class's getters and setters:
```
    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public String getBrand() {
        return brand;
    }
    public void setBrand(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }
    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
    // Rest of the setters and getters. See the whole source   code from GitHub
```

9. We also have to add new properties to the `application.properties` file. This allows us to log the SQL statements to the console. Since Spring Boot version 2.3.0, we also have to define the data source URL. Open the ``application.properties`` file and add the following two lines to the file:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

> Important Note
> 
> When you are editing the `application.properties` file, you have to make sure that there are no extra spaces at the end of the lines. Otherwise, the settings won't work. This might happen often when you copy/paste settings.
{.is-info}

Now, the `car` table is created in the database when we run the application. At this point, we can see the table creation statements in the console when running the application:

![ 103-04 Car table SQL statements ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-04_car_table_sql_statements.webp)

> Important Note
> 
> If `spring.datasource.url` is not defined in the `application.properties` file, Spring Boot creates a random data source URL that can be seen in the console when you run the application; for example, `H2 console available at '/h2-console'. Database available at 'jdbc:h2:mem:`b92ad05e-8af4-4c33-b22d-ccbf9ffe491e'.
{.is-info}

11. The H2 database provides a web-based console that can be used to explore a database and execute SQL statements. To enable the console, we have to add the following lines to the `application.properties` file. The first setting enables the H2 console, while the second defines the path of the H2 console:
```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true 
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
```

12. You can access the H2 console by navigating to localhost:8080/h2-console using your web browser. Use jdbc:h2:mem:testdb as JDBC URL and leave the Password field empty in the Login window. Press the Connect button to log into the console, as shown in the following screenshot:

![ 103-05 H2 console login ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-05_h2_console_login.webp)

> Tip
> 
> You can also change the H2 database username and password by using the following settings in the `application.properties` file: `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password.`
{.is-success}

Now, you can see our `CAR` table in the database. You may notice that the register number has an underscore between the words. The reason for the underscore is the camel case naming of the attribute (`registerNumber`):

![ 103-06 H2 console ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-06_h2_console.webp)

With that, we have created our first entity class and learned how JPA generates a database table from the entity class. Next, we will create a repository class that provides CRUD operations.

# Creating CRUD repositories

The Spring Boot Data JPA provides a `CrudRepository` interface for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. It provides CRUD functionalities to our entity class.

Let's create our repository in the `domain` package, as follows:

1. Create a new class called `CarRepository` in the `com.packt.cardatabase.domain` package and modify the file according to the following code snippet:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import org.springframework.data.repository
.CrudRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends CrudRepository<Car, Long> {
}
```

`CarRepository` now extends the Spring Boot JPA `CrudRepository` interface. The `<Car, Long>` type arguments define that this is the repository for the `Car` entity class and that the type of the ID field is `Long`.

The `CrudRepository` interface provides multiple CRUD methods that we can now start to use. The following table lists the most commonly used methods:

![ 103-07 CRUD methods ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-07_crud_methods.webp)

If the method returns only one item, `Optional<T>` is returned instead of `T`. The `Optional` class was introduced in Java 8 SE and is a type of single-value container that either contains a value or doesn't. If there is value, the `isPresent()` method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. If there is a value, you can get it by using the `get()` method. By using `Optional`, we can prevent null pointer exceptions.

2. After adding the CarRepository class, your project structure should look as follows:

![ 103-08 Project structure ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-08_project_structure.jpg)

3. Now, we are ready to add some demonstration data to our H2 database. For that, we will use the Spring Boot `CommandLineRunner` interface. The `CommandLineRunner` interface allows us to execute additional code before the application has fully started. Therefore, it is a good point to add demo data to your database. Your Spring Boot application's `main` class implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface. Therefore, we should implement the `run` method, as shown in the following `CardatabaseApplication.java` code:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.
SpringBootApplication;
@SpringBootApplication
public class CardatabaseApplication implements CommandLineRunner {    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run
            (CardatabaseApplication.class, args);
    }
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        // Place your code here        
    }
}
```

4. Next, we have to inject our car repository into the main class to be able to save new car objects to the database. An `@Autowired` annotation is used to enable dependency injection. This allows us to pass dependencies into an object. We will also add a logger to our main class:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase;    
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation
.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.
SpringBootApplication;
import com.packt.cardatabase.domain.Car;
import com.packt.cardatabase.domain.CarRepository;
@SpringBootApplication
public class CardatabaseApplication implements CommandLineRunner {
    private static final Logger logger = 
        LoggerFactory.getLogger(CardatabaseAp
            plication.class);
    @Autowired
    private CarRepository repository;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run
            (CardatabaseApplication.class, args);
    }
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
     // Place your code here
    }
}
```

5. Once we have injected the repository class, we can use the CRUD methods it provides in the `run` method. The following sample code shows how to insert a few cars into the database using the `save` method. We will also use the repository's `findAll()` method to fetch all the cars from the database and print them to the console using the logger:

```
    // CardataseApplication.java run method
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        repository.save(new Car(‚ÄúFord", ‚ÄúMustang", ‚ÄúRed", 
            ‚ÄúADF-1121", 2021, 59000));
        repository.save(new  Car(‚ÄúNissan", ‚ÄúLeaf", ‚ÄúWhite", 
            ‚ÄúSSJ-3002", 2019, 29000));
        repository.save(new Car(‚ÄúToyota", ‚ÄúPrius", 
            ‚ÄúSilver", 
            ‚ÄúKKO-0212", 2020, 39000));
        // Fetch all cars and log to console
        for (Car car : repository.findAll()) {
            logger.info(car.getBrand() + ‚Äú ‚Äú + car
                .getModel());
        }
    }
```

The `insert` statements and cars we logged can be seen in the Eclipse console once the application has been executed:

![ 103-09 Insert statements ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-09_insert_statements.webp)

You can now use the H2 console to fetch cars from the database, as shown in the following screenshot:

![ 103-10 H2 console ‚Äì Select cars ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-10_h2_console_‚Äì_select_cars.webp)

6. You can define your queries in the Spring Data repositories. The query must start with a prefix; for example, `findBy`. After the prefix, you must define the entity class fields that are used in the query. The following is some sample code for three simple queries:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.data.repository.
CrudRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends CrudRepository
    <Car, Long> {
    // Fetch cars by brand
    List<Car> findByBrand(String brand);
    
    // Fetch cars by color
    List<Car> findByColor(String color);
    
    // Fetch cars by year
    List<Car> findByYear(int year);
}
```

There can be multiple fields after the `By` keyword, concatenated with the `And` and `or` keywords:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.data.repository.
CrudRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends CrudRepository
    <Car, Long> {
    // Fetch cars by brand and model
    List<Car> findByBrandAndModel(String brand, String 
        model);
    
    // Fetch cars by brand or color
    List<Car> findByBrandOrColor(String brand, String 
    color);
}
```

Queries can be sorted by using the `OrderBy` keyword in the query method:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.data.repository.
CrudRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends CrudRepository
    <Car, Long> {
    // Fetch cars by brand and sort by year
    List<Car> findByBrandOrderByYearAsc(String brand);
}
```

7. You can also create queries by using SQL statements via the `@Query` annotation. The following example shows the usage of a SQL query in `CrudRepository`:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.
CrudRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends CrudRepository
    <Car, Long> {
    // Fetch cars by brand using SQL
    @Query(‚Äúselect c from Car c where c.brand = ?1") 
    List<Car> findByBrand(String brand);
}
```

With the `@Query` annotation, you can use more advanced expressions, such as `like`. The following example shows the usage of the like query in `CrudRepository`:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends CrudRepository
    <Car, Long> {
    // Fetch cars by brand using SQL
    @Query(‚Äúselect c from Car c where c.brand like
        %?1") 
    List<Car> findByBrandEndsWith(String brand);
}
```

Spring Data JPA also provides `PagingAndSortingRepository`, which extends `CrudRepository`. This offers methods to fetch entities using pagination and sorting. This is a good option if you are dealing with larger amounts of data because you don't have to return everything from a large result set. You can also sort your data into some meaningful order. `PagingAndSortingRepository` can be created in a similar way to how we created `CrudRepository`:

```
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import org.springframework.data.repository.
PagingAndSortingRepository;
public interface CarRepository extends 
    PagingAndSortingRepository <Car, Long> {
}
```

In this case, you now have the two new additional methods that the repository provides:

![ 103-11 PagingAndSortingRepository methods ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-11_pagingandsortingrepository_methods.jpg)

At this point, we have completed our first database table and we are ready to add relationships between the database tables.

# Adding relationships between tables

Next, we create a new table called `owner` that has a one-to-many relationship with the `car` table. In this case, a one-to-many relationship means that the owner can own multiple cars, but a car can only have one owner. The following Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram shows the relationship between the tables:

![ 103-12 OneToMany relationship ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-12_onetomany_relationship.jpg)

The following are the steps to create a new table:

1. First, we must create the `Owner` entity and repository in the `com.packt.cardatabase.domain` package. The `Owner` entity and repository are created in a similar way to the `Car` class.
The following is the source code of the `Owner` entity class:

```
// Owner.java
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
@Entity
public class Owner {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private long ownerid;
    private String firstname, lastname;
    
    public Owner() {}
    public Owner(String firstname, String lastname) {
        super();
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.lastname = lastname;
    }
    public long getOwnerid() {
        return ownerid;
    }
    public void setOwnerid(long ownerid) {
        this.ownerid = ownerid;
    }
    public String getFirstname() {
        return firstname;
    }
    public void setFirstname(String firstname) {
        this.firstname = firstname;
    }
    public String getLastname() {
        return lastname;
    }
    public void setLastname(String lastname) {
        this.lastname = lastname;
    }
}
```

The following is the source code for `OwnerRepository`:

```
// OwnerRepository.java
package com.packt.cardatabase.domain;
import org.springframework.data.repository.
CrudRepository;
public interface OwnerRepository extends  
    CrudRepository<Owner, Long> {
}
```

2. Now is a good time to check that everything is working. Run the project and check that both database tables have been created and that there are no errors in the console. The following screenshot shows the console messages when the tables are created:

![ 103-13 The car and owner tables ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-13_the_car_and_owner_tables.jpg)

Now, our domain package contains two entity classes and repositories:

![ 103-14 Project Explorer ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-14_project_explorer.jpg)

3. The one-to-many relationship can be added by using the `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` annotations. In the car entity class, which contains a foreign key, you must define the relationship with the `@ManyToOne` annotation. You should also add the getter and setter for the owner field. It is recommended that you use `FetchType.LAZY` for all associations. For the toMany relationships, that is the default value, but for the toOne relationships, you should define it. `FetchType` defines the strategy for fetching data from the database. The value can be either `EAGER` or `LAZY`. In our case, the lazy strategy means that when the owner is fetched from the database, all the cars associated with the owner will be fetched when needed. Eager means that the cars will be fetched immediately by the owner. The following source code shows how to define a one-to-many relationship in the `Car` class:

```
// Car.java
@ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name="owner")
private Owner owner;
//Getter and setter
public Owner getOwner()  {
    return owner;
}
public void setOwner(Owner owner)  {
    this.owner = owner;
}
```

4. In the owner entity site, the relationship is defined with the `@OneToMany` annotation. The type of field is `List<Car>` because the owner may have multiple cars. Now, you can add the getter and setter for this, as follows:

```
// Owner.java
@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy="owner")
private List<Car> cars;
    
public List<Car> getCars()  {
    return cars;
}
    
public void setCars(List<Car> cars)  {
    this.cars = cars;
}
```

The `@OneToMany` annotation has two attributes that we are using. The `cascade` attribute defines how cascading affects the entities in the case of deletions or updates. The ALL attribute setting means that all operations are cascaded. For example, if the owner is deleted, the cars that are linked to that owner are deleted as well. The `mappedBy="owner"` attribute setting tells us that the `Car` class has the `owner` field, which is the foreign key for this relationship.

When you run the project, by looking in the console, you will see that the relationship has been created:

5. Now, we can add some owners to the database with `CommandLineRunner`. Let's also modify the `Car` entity class constructor and add an `owner` object there:

```
// Car.java constructor
public Car(String brand, String model, String color, 
    String registerNumber, int year, int price, Owner 
        owner) {
    super();
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
    this.registerNumber = registerNumber;
    this.year = year;
    this.price = price;
    this.owner = owner;
}
```

6. First, we will create two owner objects and save these to the database using the repository's `saveAll` method, which we can use to save multiple entities at once. To save the owners, we have to inject `OwnerRepository` into the main class. Then, we must connect the owners to the cars by using the `Car` constructor. First, let's modify the `CardatabaseApplication` class by adding the following imports:

```
// CardatabaseApplication.java
import com.packt.cardatabase.domain.Owner;
import com.packt.cardatabase.domain.OwnerRepository;
```

Now, let's inject `OwnerRepository` into the `CardatabaseApplication` class:

```
@Autowired
private OwnerRepository orepository;
```

At this point, we must modify the `run` method to save owners and link owners and cars:

```
@Override
public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
    // Add owner objects and save these to db 
    Owner owner1 = new Owner(‚ÄúJohn" , ‚ÄúJohnson");
    Owner owner2 = new  Owner(‚ÄúMary" , ‚ÄúRobinson");
    orepository.saveAll(Arrays.asList(owner1, 
        owner2));
    // Add car object and link to owners and save 
       these to db
    Car car1 = new Car(‚ÄúFord", ‚ÄúMustang", ‚ÄúRed", 
      ‚ÄúADF-1121", 2021, 59000, owner1);
    Car car2 = new Car(‚ÄúNissan", ‚ÄúLeaf", ‚ÄúWhite", 
      ‚ÄúSSJ-3002", 2019, 29000, owner2);
    Car car3 = new Car(‚ÄúToyota", ‚ÄúPrius", ‚ÄúSilver", 
      ‚ÄúKKO-0212", 2020, 39000, owner2);
    repository.saveAll(Arrays.asList(car1, car2, 
        car3));
    for (Car car : repository.findAll()) {
         logger.info(car.getBrand() + ‚Äú ‚Äú + 
             car.getModel());
    }
}
```

Now, if you run the application and fetch cars from the database, you will see that the owners are now linked to the cars:

![ 103-16 OneToMany relationship ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-16_onetomany_relationship.jpg)

If you want to create a many-to-many relationship instead, which means, in practice, that an owner can have multiple cars and a car can have multiple owners, you should use the `@ManyToMany` annotation. In our example application, we will use a one-to-many relationship. The code that you have completed here will be needed in the next chapter.

Next, you will learn how to change the relationship to many-to-many. In a many-to-many relationship, it is recommended that you use `Set` instead of `List` with Hibernate:

1. In the `Car` entity class's many-to-many relationship, define the getters and setters in the following way:
```
// Car.java
@ManyToMany(mappedBy="cars")
private Set<Owner> owners = new HashSet<Owner>();
public Set<Owner> getOwners() {
    return owners;
}
public void setOwners(Set<Owner> owners) {
    this.owners = owners;
}
```

2. In the `Owner` entity class, the many-to-many relationship is defined as follows:

```
// Owner.java
@ManyToMany(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
@JoinTable(name="car_owner", 
  joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name="ownerid") }, 
  inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name="id") })
private Set<Car> cars = new HashSet<Car>();
    
public Set<Car> getCars() {
    return cars;
}
    
public void setCars(Set<Car> cars) {
    this.cars = cars;
}
```

3. Now, if you run the application, there will be a new join table called `car_owner` that is created between the car and owner tables. The join table is a special kind of table that manages the many-to-many relationship between two tables. The join table is defined by using the `@JoinTable` annotation. With this annotation, we can set the name of the join table and join columns. The following screenshot shows the database structure when using a many-to-many relationship:

![ 103-17 Many-to-many relationship ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-17_many-to-many_relationship.jpg)

Now, the database UML diagram looks as follows:

![ 103-18 database UML diagram looks as ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-18_database_uml_diagram_looks_as.jpg)

Now that we have used an in-memory H2 database, we are going to use a MariaDB database instead.

# Setting up a MariaDB database

Now, we will switch our database from H2 to MariaDB. The database tables are still created automatically by JPA. However, before we run our application, we have to create a database for it. In this section, we will be using the one-to-many relationship from the previous section.

The database can be created by using HeidiSQL. Open HeidiSQL and follow these steps:

1. Right-click inside the database list.
2. Then, select **Create new | Database**:

![ 103-19 Create new ‚Äì Database ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-19_create_new_‚Äì_database.jpg)

3. Let's name our database `cardb`. After clicking OK, you should see the new `cardb` database in the database list:

![ 103-20 The cardb database ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-20_the_cardb_database.jpg)

4. In Spring Boot, add a MariaDB Java client dependency to the `pom.xml` file and remove the H2 dependency since we don't need it anymore:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

5. In the `application.properties` file, you must define the database connection. First, you must define the database's URL, username, password (defined in Chapter 1,‚Ä®Setting Up the Environment and Tools ‚Äì Backend), and database driver class:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/cardb 
spring.datasource.username=root 
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD 
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
```

6. The `spring.jpa.generate-ddl` setting defines whether JPA should initialize the database (true/false). The `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` setting defines the behavior of the database initialization. The possible values are `none`, `validate`, `update`, `create`, and `create-drop`. The default value depends on your database. If you are using an embedded database such as H2, the default value is `create-drop`, otherwise, the default value is `none`. `create-drop` means that the database is created when an application starts and it is dropped when the application is stopped. The `create` value only creates the database when the application is started. The `update` value creates the database and updates the schema if it has changed:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb:
//localhost:3306/cardb 
spring.datasource.username=root 
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD 
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=
    org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true 
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
```

7. Check that the MariaDB database server is running and run your Spring Boot application. After running the application, you should see the tables in MariaDB. You might have to refresh the database tree in HeidiSQL first by pressing the F5 key. The following screenshot shows the HeidiSQL user interface once the database has been created. You can also run SQL queries in HeidiSQL, as shown in the following screenshot:

![ 103-21 MariaDB cardb ](/medium/2204_springboot_react_3e/103-21_mariadb_cardb.jpg)

Now, your application is ready to use with MariaDB.

# Summary

In this chapter, we used JPA to create our Spring Boot application database. First, we created entity classes, which are mapped to database tables. Then, we created `CrudRepository` for our entity class, which provides CRUD operations for the entity. After that, we managed to add some demo data to our database by using `CommandLineRunner`. We also created one-to-many relationships between two entities. At the beginning of this chapter, we used the H2 in-memory database, while at the end, we switched the database to MariaDB.

In the next chapter, we will create a RESTful web service for our backend. We will also look at testing the RESTful web service with the curl command-line tool, and also by using Postman GUI.
